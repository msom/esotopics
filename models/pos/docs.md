>702 It is this Trinity that is allegorized by the “Three Steps of Vishnu,” which mean—Vishnu being considered as the Infinite in exotericism—that from Parabrahman issued Mûlaprakriti, Purusha (the Logos) and Prakriti; the four forms—with itself, the synthesis—of Vâch. And in the Kabalah, Ain Suph, Shekinah, Adam Kadmon and Sephira, the four, or the three, emanations being distinct—yet One.

>The indestructible and the destructible, such is the double manifestation of the Self. Of these the indestructible is the existent [the true essence or nature of Self, the underlying principles], the manifestation as an individual (entity) is called the destructible.
## 3: Blavatsky (1888) 720 [0.9661]

>The seventh being Malkuth, which is our Earth on its plane, and the lowest on all the other planes of conscious existence. The Chaldean Book of Numbers contains a detailed explanation of all this.

>(a) The phrase, “through the Seven Worlds of Mâyâ,” refers here to the seven Globes of the Planetary Chain and the seven Rounds, or the forty-nine stations of active existence that are before the “Spark,” or Monad, at the beginning of every Great Life‐Cycle, or Manvantara. The “Thread of Fohat” is the Thread of Life before referred to.

>These Dhyân Chohans, as we see, do not pass through the three kingdoms as do the lower Pitris; nor do they incarnate in man until the Third Root Race. Thus, as the teaching stands:

>285 Occultism divides the periods of Rest (Pralaya) into several kinds: there is the Individual Pralaya of each Globe, as humanity and life pass on to the next—seven minor Pralayas in each Round; the Planetary Pralaya, when seven Rounds are completed; the Solar Pralaya, when the whole system is at an end; and finally the Universal Pralaya, Mahâ or Brahmâ Pralaya, at the close of the Age of Brahmâ. These are the chief Pralayas or “destruction periods.” There are many other minor ones, but with these we are not concerned at present.
## 7: Blavatsky (1888) 2119 [0.8956]

>84 Hence Non‐Being is “Absolute Being,” in Esoteric Philosophy. In the tenets of the latter even Âdi‐Buddha (the First or Primeval Wisdom) is, while manifested, in one sense an Illusion, Mâyâ, since all the gods, including Brahmâ, have to die at the end of the Age of Brahmâ; the abstraction called Parabrahman—whether we call it Ain Suph, or with Herbert Spencer the Unknowable—alone being the One Absolute Reality. The One Secondless Existence is Advaita, “Without a Second,” and all the rest is Mâyâ, so teaches the Advaita Philosophy.
## 8: Blavatsky (1888) 656 [0.89]

>(7.) The Seventh Spirit, the last emanated from the “Mother,” appears as the first divine human form distinctly male and female. It was the seventh “creation,” as in the Purânas, wherein man is the seventh creation of Brahmâ.

>2. The Dhyânis [Pitris] are those who have evolved their Bhuta [Doubles] from themselves, which Rûpa [Form] has become the vehicle of Monads [Seventh and Sixth principles] that had completed their cycle of transmigration in the three preceding Kalpas [Rounds]. Then, they [the Astral Doubles] became the men of the first Human Race of the Round. But they were not complete, and were senseless.
## 11: Blavatsky (1888) 109 [0.8717]

>What is it that ever is?—Space, the eternal Anupâdaka [Parentless]. What is it that ever was?—The Germ in the Root. What is it that is ever coming and going?—The Great Breath. Then, there are three Eternals?—No, the three are one. That which ever is is one, that which ever was is one, that which is ever being and becoming is also one: and this is Space.
## 12: Blavatsky (1888) 641 [0.8676]

>The chief Hierarchies among these are hinted at in the great Quaternary, or the “four bodies and the three faculties,” exoterically, of Brahmâ and the Panchâsya, the five Brahmâs, or the five Dhyâni‐Buddhas in the Buddhist system.

>5. Every Life‐Cycle on Globe D (our Earth) is composed of seven Root-Races. They commence with the ethereal and end with the spiritual, on the double line of physical and moral evolution—from the beginning of the Terrestrial Round to its close. One is a “Planetary Round” from Globe A to Globe G, the seventh; the other, the “Globe Round,” or the Terrestrial.
## 15: Blavatsky (1888) 2195 [0.8596]

>493 The manifested Spirit: Absolute, Divine Spirit is one with absolute Divine Substance; Parabrahman and Mûlaprakriti are one in essence. Therefore, Cosmic Ideation and Cosmic Substance, in their primal character, are one also.
## 16: Blavatsky (1888) 235 [0.8554]

>All this, teaches the Hidden Science, is but the temporary reflection, the shadow of the eternal ideal prototype in Divine Thought; the word “Eternity,” note well again, standing here only in the sense of “Æon,” as lasting throughout the seemingly interminable, but still limited cycle of activity, called by us Manvantara. For what is the real esoteric meaning of Manvantara, or rather a Manu‐antara? It means, literally, “between two Manus,” of whom there are fourteen in every Day of Brahmâ, such a Day consisting of 1,000 aggregates of four Ages, 1,000 “Great Ages” or Mahâyugas. Let us now analyse the word or name Manu. Orientalists in their dictionaries tell us that the term “Manu” is from the root man, “to think”; hence “the thinking man.” But, esoterically, every Manu, as an anthropomorphized patron of his special cycle (or Round), is but the personified idea of the “Thought Divine” (as the Hermetic Pymander); each of the Manus, therefore, being the special god, the creator and fashioner of all that appears during his own respective cycle of being or Manvantara. Fohat runs the Manus’ (or Dhyân Chohans’) errands, and causes the ideal prototypes to expand from within without—that is, to cross gradually, on a descending scale, all the planes, from the noumenal to the lowest phenomenal, to bloom finally on the last into full objectivity—the acme of Illusion, or the grossest matter.
## 17: Blavatsky (1888) 135 [0.8539]

>The seven Stanzas given in this volume represent the seven terms of this abstract formula. They refer to, and describe, the seven great stages of the evolutionary process, which are spoken of in the Purânas as the “Seven Creations,” and in the Bible as the “Days” of Creation.

>758 They may indeed mark a “special” or extra “creation,” since it is they who, by incarnating themselves within the senseless human shells of the two first Root‐Races, and a great portion of the Third Root‐Race, create, so to speak, a new race: that of thinking, self‐conscious and divine men.

>(VI) The Sixth Creation: the Ûrdhvasrotas Creation, or that of Divinities. But these Divinities are simply the Prototypes of the First Race, the Fathers of their “mind‐born” progeny with the “soft bones.” It is these who became the Evolvers of the “Sweat‐born”—an expression explained in Volume II.

>119 By “God, the Father,” the seventh principle in Man and Kosmos are here unmistakably meant, this principle being inseparable in its Esse and Nature from the seventh cosmic principle. In one sense it is the Logos of the Greeks and the Avalokiteshvara of the Esoteric “Buddhists.”
## 24: Blavatsky (1888) 122 [0.8335]

>The Manifested Universe, therefore, is pervaded by duality, which is, as it were, the very essence of its Ex‐istence as Manifestation. But just as the opposite poles of Subject and Object, Spirit and Matter, are but aspects of the One Unity in which they are synthesized, so, in the Manifested Universe, there is “that” which links Spirit to Matter, Subject to Object.
## 25: Blavatsky (1888) 1851 [0.8292]

>The sons of Bhûmi [Earth] regard the Sons of Deva‐lokas [Angel-spheres] as their Gods; and the Sons of lower kingdoms look up to the men of Bhûmi as to their Devas [Gods]; men remaining unaware of it in their blindness.... They [men] tremble before them while using them [for magical purposes].... The First Race of Men were the “Mind‐born Sons” of the former. They [the Pitris and Devas] are our progenitors.
## 26: Blavatsky (1888) 660 [0.8267]

>The number seven, as applied to the term Septenary Host, above mentioned, does not imply only seven Entities, but seven Groups or Hosts, as explained before. The highest Group, the Asuras born in Brahmâ’s first body, which turned into “Night,” are septenary, i.e., divided like the Pitris into seven Classes, three of which are bodiless (arûpa) and four with bodies. They are in fact more truly our Pitris (Ancestors) than the Pitris who projected the first physical man.
## 27: Blavatsky (1888) 176 [0.8094]

>First, the Divine, the One from the Mother‐Spirit; then, the Spiritual; the Three from the One, the Four from the One, and the Five, from which the Three, the Five and the Seven. These are the Three‐fold and the Four-fold downward; the Mind‐born Sons of the First Lord, the Shining Seven. It is they who are thou, I, he, O Lanoo; they who watch over thee and thy mother, Bhûmî.

>xxviii. The former—the Initial Existence—which may be called, while in this state of being, the ONE LIFE, is, as explained, a Film for creative or formative purposes. It manifests in seven states, which, with their septenary sub‐divisions, are the Forty‐nine Fires mentioned in sacred books....
## 29: Blavatsky (1888) 1733 [0.7986]

>While the Christian is taught that the human Soul is a breath of God, being created by him for sempiternal existence, having a beginning, but no end—and therefore never to be called eternal—the Occult Teaching says: Nothing is created, it is only transformed. Nothing can manifest itself in this Universe—from a globe down to a vague, rapid thought—that was not in the Universe already; everything on the subjective plane is an eternal is; as everything on the objective plane is an ever‐becoming—because all is transitory.
## 30: Blavatsky (1888) 202 [0.7967]

>8. ALONE, THE ONE FORM OF EXISTENCE (A) STRETCHED BOUNDLESS, INFINITE, CAUSELESS, IN DREAMLESS SLEEP (B); AND LIFE PULSATED UNCONSCIOUS IN UNIVERSAL SPACE, THROUGHOUT THAT ALL‐PRESENCE, WHICH IS SENSED BY THE OPENED EYE OF DANGMA.

>421 It is only the mediæval Kabalists who, following the Jewish and one or two Neo‐Platonists, applied the term Microcosm to man. Ancient philosophy called the Earth the Microcosm of the Macrocosm, and man the outcome of the two.
## 32: Blavatsky (1888) 214 [0.7959]

>(a) The “Builders,” the “Sons of Manvantaric Dawn,” are the real creators of the Universe; and in this doctrine, which deals only with our Planetary System, they, as the architects of the latter, are also called the “Watchers” of the Seven Spheres, which exoterically are the seven planets, and esoterically the seven earths or spheres (Globes) of our Chain also. The opening sentence of Stanza I, when mentioning “Seven Eternities,” applies both to the Mahâkalpa or “the (Great) Age of Brahmâ,” as well as to the Solar Pralaya and subsequent resurrection of our Planetary System on a higher plane. There are many kinds of Pralaya (dissolution of a thing visible), as will be shown elsewhere.
## 33: Blavatsky (1888) 119 [0.7873]

>Spirit (or Consciousness) and Matter are, however, to be regarded, not as independent realities, but as the two symbols or aspects of the Absolute, Parabrahman, which constitute the basis of conditioned Being whether subjective or objective.

>The Secret Doctrine teaches no Atheism, except in the sense underlying the Sanskrit word Nâstika, a rejection of idols, including every anthropomorphic God. In this sense every Occultist is a Nâstika.

>And so it goes on for three Rounds, when it slackens, and finally stops at the threshold of our Globe, in the Fourth Round; because the human period (of the true physical men to be), the seventh, is now reached. This is evident, for as said:

>61 The term “Wheel” is the symbolical expression for a world or globe, which shows that the ancients were aware that our Earth was a revolving globe, not a motionless square as some Christian Fathers taught. The “Great Wheel” is the whole duration of our Cycle of Being, or Mahâkalpa, i.e., the whole revolution of our special Chain of seven Globes or Spheres from beginning to end; the “Small Wheels” meaning the Rounds, of which there are also seven.
## 37: Blavatsky (1888) 801 [0.7714]

>The Universe is the periodical manifestation of this unknown Absolute Essence. To call it “Essence,” however, is to sin against the very spirit of the philosophy. For though the noun may be derived in this case from the verb esse, “to be,” yet IT cannot be identified with a “being” of any kind, that can be conceived by human intellect. IT is best described as neither Spirit nor Matter, but both. Parabrahman and Mûlaprakriti are One, in reality, yet TWO in the universal conception of the Manifested, even in the conception of the One Logos, the first “Manifestation,” to which, as the able lecturer shows, in the “Notes on the Bhagavadgîtâ,” IT appears from the objective standpoint as Mûlaprakriti, and not as Parabrahman; as its Veil, and not the One Reality hidden behind, which is unconditioned and absolute.
## 38: Blavatsky (1888) 398 [0.7684]

>Moreover, in Occult metaphysics, there are, properly speaking, two “Ones”—the One on the unreachable plane of Absoluteness and Infinity, on which no speculation is possible; and the second One on the plane of Emanations. The former can neither emanate nor be divided, as it is eternal, absolute, and immutable; but the second, being, so to speak, the reflection of the first One (for it is the Logos, or Îshvara, in the Universe of Illusion), can do so. It emanates from itself—as the upper Sephirothal Triad emanates the lower seven Sephiroth—the seven Rays or Dhyân Chohans; in other words, the Homogeneous becomes the Heterogeneous, the Protyle differentiates into the Elements. But these, unless they return into their primal Element, can never cross beyond the Laya, or zero‐point. This metaphysical tenet can hardly be better described than in T. Subba Row’s Bhagavadgîtâ Lectures:
## 39: Blavatsky (1888) 537 [0.7637]

>The most developed, the Lunar Monads, reach the human germ‐stage in the First Round; become terrestrial, though very ethereal, human beings towards the end of the Third Round, remaining on the Globe through the “obscuration” period, as the seed for future mankind in the Fourth Round, and thus become the pioneers of Humanity at the beginning of this, the present Fourth Round. Others reach the human stage only during later Rounds, i.e., in the second, third or first half of the Fourth Round. And finally the most retarded of all—i.e., those still occupying animal forms after the middle turning‐point of the Fourth Round—will not become men at all during this Manvantara. They will reach to the verge of Humanity only at the close of the Seventh Round, to be, in their turn, ushered into a new Chain, after Pralaya, by older pioneers, the progenitors of Humanity, or the Seed‐Humanity (Shishta), viz., the men who will be at the head of all at the end of these Rounds.
## 40: Blavatsky (1888) 840 [0.7586]

>Trismegistus: Reality is not upon the earth, my son, and it cannot be thereon.... Nothing on earth is real, there are only appearances.... He [man] is not real, my son, as man. The real consists solely in itself and remains what it is.... Man is transient, therefore he is not real, he is but appearance, and appearance is the supreme illusion.

>6. The Lipika circumscribe the Triangle, the First One, the Cube, the Second One, and the Pentacle within the Egg. It is the Ring called “Pass Not” for those who descend and ascend; who during the Kalpa are progressing towards the Great Day “Be With Us.”... Thus were formed the Arûpa and the Rûpa: from One Light, Seven Lights; from each of the Seven, seven times Seven Lights. The Wheels watch the Ring....

>In this manner—as were the seven forms [principles] of Prakriti reckoned from Mahat to Earth—so at the (time of elemental) dissolution (pratyâhâra), these seven successively reënter into each other. The Egg of Brahmâ (Sarva‐mandala) is dissolved, with its seven zones (dvîpa), seven oceans, seven regions, etc.

>969 The Tanmâtras are literally the type or rudiment of an element devoid of qualities; but esoterically, they are the primeval Noumena of that which becomes in the progress of evolution, a Cosmic Element, in the sense given to the term in Antiquity, not in that of Physics. They are the Logoi, the seven emanations or rays of the Logos.
## 44: Blavatsky (1888) 1742 [0.7489]

>The Logos, or both the unmanifested and the manifested Word, is called by the Hindûs, Îshvara, the Lord, though the Occultists give it another name. Îshvara, say the Vedântins, is the highest consciousness in Nature. “This highest consciousness,” answer the Occultists, “is only a synthetic unit in the World of the manifested Logos—or on the plane of illusion; for it is the sum total of Dhyân Chohanic consciousness.” “O wise man, remove the conception that Not‐Spirit is Spirit”—says Shankarâchârya. Âtmâ is Not-Spirit in its final Parabrahmic state; Îshvara, or Logos, is Spirit; or, as Occultism explains, it is a compound unity of manifested living Spirits, the parent‐source and nursery of all the mundane and terrestrial Monads, plus their divine Reflection, which emanate from, and return into, the Logos, each in the culmination of its time. There are seven chief Groups of such Dhyân Chohans, which groups will be found and recognized in every religion, for they are the primeval Seven Rays. Humanity, Occultism teaches us, is divided into seven distinct Groups, with their sub‐divisions, mental, spiritual, and physical. Hence there are seven chief planets, the spheres of the indwelling seven Spirits, under each of which is born one of the human Groups which is guided and influenced thereby. There are only seven planets specially connected with Earth, and twelve houses, but the possible combinations of their aspects are countless. As each planet can stand to each of the others in twelve different aspects, their combinations must be almost infinite; as infinite, in fact, as the spiritual, psychic, mental, and physical capacities in the numberless varieties of the genus homo, each of which varieties is born under one of the seven planets and one of the said countless planetary combinations.
## 45: Blavatsky (1888) 726 [0.7449]

>The Shinto idea of creation is as follows: Out of Chaos (Konton) the Earth (In) was the sediment precipitated, and the Heavens (Yo) the ethereal essences which ascended: Man (Jin) appeared between the two. The first man was called Kuni‐to ko tatchino‐mikoto, and five other names were given to him, and then the human race appeared, male and female. Isanagi and Isanami begat Tenshoko doijin, the first of the five Gods of the Earth.
## 46: Blavatsky (1888) 290 [0.7435]

>(b) The expression, “all is One Number, issued from No‐Number,” relates again to that universal and philosophical tenet just explained in the commentary on Shloka 4 of Stanza III. That which is absolute, is of course No‐Number; but in its later significance it has an application both in Space and in Time. It means that not only every increment of time is part of a larger increment, up to the most indefinitely prolonged duration conceivable by the human intellect, but also that no manifested thing can be thought of except as part of a whole: the total aggregate being the One Manifested Universe that issues from the Unmanifested or Absolute—called Non‐Being, or “No‐Number,” to distinguish it from Being, or the “One Number.”
## 47: Blavatsky (1888) 134 [0.7435]

>The Stanzas, therefore, give an abstract formula which can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to all evolution: to that of our tiny Earth, to that of the Chain of Planets of which that Earth forms one, to the Solar Universe to which that Chain belongs and so on, in an ascending scale, till the mind reels and is exhausted in the effort.

## 49: Blavatsky (1888) 400 [0.7425]

>For, as the lecturer premised by saying, Parabrahman is not this or that, it is not even consciousness, as it cannot be related to matter or anything conditioned. It is not Ego nor is it Non‐Ego, nor even Âtmâ, but verily the one source of all manifestations and modes of existence.

>(a) That which is meant by the qualification the “Fourth,” is explained as the Fourth Round, only on the authority of the Commentaries. It can equally mean Fourth Eternity as Fourth Round, or even our Fourth Globe. For, as will repeatedly be shown, the latter is the fourth sphere, on the fourth or lowest plane of material life. And it so happens that we are in the Fourth Round, at the middle point of which the perfect equilibrium between Spirit and Matter had to take place.

>1. Everything in the metaphysical as in the physical Universe is septenary. Hence every sidereal body, every planet, whether visible or invisible, is credited with six companion Globes. The evolution of life proceeds on these seven Globes or bodies, from the First to the Seventh, in Seven Rounds or Seven Cycles.

>Commenting upon which emendation of Medhâtithi, the editor remarks: “the five elements plus mind [Manas] and self‐consciousness [Ahamkâra] are probably meant; ‘subtile elements,’ as before [meaning] ‘fine portions of form’ [or principles].” Verse 20 shows this, when saying of these five elements, or “fine portions of form” (Rûpa plus Manas and Self‐Consciousness) that they constitute the “Seven Purusha,” or Principles, called in the Purânas the “Seven Prakritis.”

These Globes are formed by a process which the Occultists call the “rebirth of Planetary Chains (or Rings).” When the Seventh and last Round of one of such Rings has been entered upon, the highest or first Globe, A, followed by all the others down to the last, instead of entering upon a certain time of rest—or “Obscuration,” as in the previous Rounds—begins to die out.

>The Esoteric Doctrine teaches that the Dhyân Chohans are the collective aggregate of Divine Intelligence or Primordial Mind, and that the first Manus, the seven “mind‐born” Spiritual Intelligences, are identical with the former. Hence the Kwan‐Shi‐Yin, the “Golden Dragon in whom are the Seven,” of Stanza III, is the Primordial Logos, or Brahmâ, the first manifested Creative Power; and the Dhyânic Energies are the Manus, or Manu Svâyambhuva collectively. The direct connection, moreover, between the Manus and Mahat is easy to see. Manu is from the root man, to think; and thinking proceeds from the mind. It is, in Cosmogony, the Pre‐nebular Period.

The Physical or Sidereal Sephiroth [personal]—one group of seven, the other of ten. 3rd. The metaphysical Sephiroth, or periphrasis of Jehovah, who are the first three Sephiroth [Kether, Chokmah and Binah], the rest of the seven being the (personal) seven Spirits of the Presence [also of the planets].

>Theo. Not at all. But immortality cannot touch the non-existent: for all that which exists as SAT, or emanates from SAT, immortality and Eternity are absolute. Matter is the opposite pole of spirit, and yet the two are one. The essence of all this, i.e., Spirit, Force and Matter, or the three in one, is as endless as it is beginningless; but the form acquired by this triple unity during its incarnations, its externality, is certainly only the illusion of our personal conceptions. Therefore do we call Nirvana and the Universal life alone a reality, while relegating the terrestrial life, its terrestrial personality included, and even its Devachanic existence, to the phantom realm of illusion.
## 69: Blavatsky (1888) 310 [0.719]

>The “Army of the Voice” is the prototype of the “Host of the Logos,” or the “Word,” of the Sepher Jetzirah, called in the Secret Doctrine the “One Number issued from No‐Number”—the One Eternal Principle. The Esoteric Theogony begins with the One Manifested (therefore not eternal in its presence and being, if eternal in its essence), the Number of the Numbers and Numbered—the latter proceeding from the Voice, the feminine Vâch, “of the hundred forms,” Shatarûpâ, or Nature. It is from this Number, 10, or Creative Nature, the Mother (the Occult cypher, or “0,” ever procreating and multiplying in union with the unit “1,” or the Spirit of Life), that the whole Universe proceeds.

>Three, five and seven are mystical numbers, and the last and the first are as greatly honoured by Masons as by Parsis—the Triangle being a symbol of Deity everywhere. As a matter of course, Doctors of Divinity—Cassel, for instance—show the Zohar explaining and supporting the Christian Trinity(!). It is the latter, however, that had its origin from the [triangle], in the archaic Occultism and Symbology of the Heathen. The Three Strides relate metaphysically to the descent of Spirit into Matter, of the Logos falling as a ray into the spirit, then into the soul, and finally into the human physical form of man, in which it becomes Life.

>Now, what is Pradhâna, if it is not Mûlaprakriti, the Root of All, in another aspect? For though Pradhâna is said, further on, to merge into the Deity, as everything else does, in order to leave the One absolute during the Pralaya, yet is it held as infinite and immortal. The literal translation is given as: “One Prâdhânika Brahma Spirit: THAT was”; and the Commentator interprets the compound term as a substantive, not as a derivative word used attributively, i.e., like something “conjoined with Pradhâna.” The student has to note, moreover, that the Purânic is a dualistic system, not evolutionary, and that, in this respect, far more will be found, from an Esoteric standpoint, in the Sânkhya, and even in the Mânava‐Dharma‐Shâstra, however much the latter differs from the former. Hence Pradhâna, even in the Purânas, is an aspect of Parabrahman, not an evolution, and must be the same as the Vedântic Mûlaprakriti. “Prakriti, in its primary state, is Âkâsha,” says a Vedântin scholar. It is almost abstract Nature.

And these are the Essences, the Flames, the Elements, the Builders, the Numbers, the Arûpa, the Rûpa, and the Force or Divine Man, the Sum Total.

>42 In contradistinction to the manifested Universe of matter, the term Mûlaprakriti (from mûla, root, and prakriti, nature), or the unmanifested primordial Matter—called by Western Alchemists Adam’s Earth—is applied by the Vedântins to Parabrahman. Matter is dual in religious metaphysics, and in esoteric teachings septenary, like everything else in the Universe. As Mûlaprakriti, it is undifferentiated and eternal: as Vyakta, it becomes differentiated and conditioned, according to Shvetâshvatara Upanishad, I, 8, and Devî Bhâgavata Purâna. The author of the Four lectures on the Bhagavad Gîtâ, in speaking of Mûlaprakriti, says: “From its [the Logos’] objective standpoint, Parabrahman appears to it as Mûlaprakriti.... Of course this Mûlaprakriti is material to it, as any material object is material to us.... Parabrahman is an unconditioned and absolute reality, and Mûlaprakriti is a sort of veil thrown over it.” (Theosophist, VIII, 304.)

>It now becomes plain, that there exists in Nature a triple evolutionary scheme for the formation of the three periodical Upâdhis; or rather three separate schemes of evolution, which in our system are inextricably interwoven and interblended at every point. These are the Monadic (or Spiritual), the Intellectual, and the Physical Evolutions. These three are the finite aspects, or the reflections on the field of Cosmic Illusion, of Âtmâ, the seventh, the One Reality.

>Here, as in all genuine philosophical systems, we find even the “Egg,” or the Circle, or Zero, Boundless Infinity, referred to as “It,” and Brahmâ, the first Unit only, referred to as the “Male” God, i.e., the fructifying Principle. It is [circle split by vertical line], or 10 (ten), the Decad. On the plane of the Septenary, or our World, only, it is called Brahmâ. On that of the Unified Decad, in the realm of Reality, this male Brahmâ is an Illusion.

In the Manifested Worlds [Solar Systems], it is, in its Objective Subjectivity, like the film from a Divine Breath to the gaze of the entranced seer. It spreads as it issues from Laya(433) throughout Infinity as a colourless spiritual fluid. It is on the Seventh Plane, and in its Seventh State, in our Planetary World.

One is its purely metaphysical aspect, as described by the learned lecturer in his “Notes on the Bhagavad Gîtâ”; the other terrestrial and physical, and at the same time divine from the stand‐point of practical human conception and Occultism. They are all the symbols and personifications of Chaos, the Great Deep, or the Primordial Waters of Space, the impenetrable Veil between the INCOGNIZABLE and the Logos of Creation. “Connecting himself through his mind with Vâch, Brahmâ [the Logos] created the Primordial Waters.” In the Katha Upanishad it is stated still more clearly:

>But the Breath of the One Existence does not, all the same, apply to the One Causeless Cause or the All‐Be‐ness, in contradistinction to All‐Being, which is Brahmâ, or the Universe. Brahmâ, the four‐faced god, who, after lifting the Earth out of the waters, “accomplished the creation,” is held to be only the Instrumental, and not, as clearly implied, the Ideal Cause. No Orientalist, so far, seems to have thoroughly comprehended the real sense of the verses in the Purânas, that treat of “creation.”

>But this “man” belongs to the Fourth Round. As shown, the Monad had passed through, journeyed and been imprisoned in, every transitional form, throughout every kingdom of nature, during the three preceding Rounds. But the Monad which becomes human, is not the Man. In this Round—with the exception of the highest mammals after man, the anthropoids destined to die out in this our race, when their Monads will be liberated and pass into the astral human forms, or the highest elementals, of the Sixth and the Seventh Races, and then into the lowest human forms in the Fifth Round—no units of any of the kingdoms are animated any longer by Monads destined to become human in their next stage, but only by the lower elementals of their respective realms. These “elementals” will become human Monads, in their turn, only at the next great planetary Manvantara.

Everything will have reëntered the Great Breath. In other words, everything will be “merged in Brahman,” or the Divine Unity.

From this verse onwards, the Stanzas are only concerned with our Solar System in general, with the Planetary Chains therein inferentially, and with the history of our Globe (the Fourth and its Chain) especially. All the verses which follow in this Volume refer only to the evolution of, and on, our Earth.

Those were formed from “the curds of the cold radiant Mother” and “the fire‐seed of the hot Father,” who “are one,” or, to express it in the plainer language of Modern Science, those Elements had their genesis in the depths of the primordial Fire‐mist, the masses of incandescent vapour of the irresolvable nebulæ; for, as Professor Newcomb shows, resolvable nebulæ do not constitute a class of proper nebulæ.

When a body dies, it passes into the same polarity as its male energy, and repels therefore the active agent, which, losing hold of the whole, fastens on the parts or molecules, this action being called chemical.

But what if we get “through the looking‐glass,” and cross the zero line in search of new principles—what shall we find on the other side of zero? Dr. Carnelly asks for an element of negative atomic weight; here is ample room and verge enough for a shadow series of such unsubstantialities. Helmholtz says that electricity is probably as atomic as matter; is electricity one of the negative elements, and the luminiferous ether another? Matter, as we now know it, does not here exist; the forms of energy which are apparent in the motions of matter are as yet only latent possibilities. A substance of negative weight is not inconceivable. But can we form a clear conception of a body which combines with other bodies in proportions expressible by negative qualities?

>When an Occultist speaks of Fohat, the energizing and guiding Intelligence in the Universal Electric or Vital Fluid, he is laughed at. Withal, as now shown, the nature neither of electricity, nor of life, nor even of light, is to this day understood. The Occultist sees in the manifestation of every force in Nature, the action of the quality, or the special characteristic of its Noumenon; which Noumenon is a distinct and intelligent Individuality on the other side of the manifested mechanical Universe. Now the Occultist does not deny—on the contrary he will support the view—that light, heat, electricity and so on are affections, not properties or qualities, of Matter. To put it more clearly: Matter is the condition, the necessary basis or vehicle, a sine quâ non, for the manifestation of these Forces, or Agents, on this plane.

>The theories built upon the rejection of Force, outside and independent of Matter pure and simple, have all been shown to be fallacious. They do not, and cannot, cover the ground, and many of the scientific data are thus proved to be unscientific. “Ether produced Sound” is said in the Purânas, and the statement is laughed at. Sound is the result of the vibrations of the air, we are corrected. And what is air? Could it exist if there were no etheric medium in Space to buoy up its molecules? The case stands simply thus. Materialism cannot admit the existence of anything outside Matter, because with the acceptance of an imponderable Force—the source and head of all the physical Forces—other intelligent Forces would have to be virtually admitted, and that would lead Science very far. For it would have to accept as a sequel the presence in Man of a still more spiritual power—entirely independent, for once, of any kind of Matter about which Physicists know anything. Hence, apart from a hypothetical Ether of Space and gross physical bodies, the whole sidereal and unseen Space is, in the sight of Materialists, one boundless void in Nature—blind, unintelligent, useless.

The intelligence that moves the Universe is fire, and fire is intelligence.

>Just so. For this discovery, the knowledge, whatever it may be worth, that light or caloric is not a motion of material particles, Science is chiefly, if not solely indebted, to Sir William Grove. It was he who in a lecture at the London Institution, in 1842, was the first to show that “heat, light, may be considered as affections of matter itself, and not of a distinct ethereal, ‘imponderable,’ fluid [a state of matter now] permeating it.” Yet, perhaps, for some Physicists—as for Œrsted, a very eminent Scientist—Force and Forces were tacitly “Spirit [and hence Spirits] in Nature.” What several rather mystical Scientists taught was that light, heat, magnetism, electricity and gravity, etc., were not the final Causes of the visible phenomena, including planetary motion, but were themselves the secondary effects of other Causes, for which Science in our day cares very little, but in which Occultism believes; for the Occultists have exhibited proofs of the validity of their claims in every age. And in what age were there no Occultists and no Adepts?

>The latter teaches that it is this original, primordial Prima Materia, divine and intelligent, the direct emanation of the Universal Mind, the Daiviprakriti—the Divine Light emanating from the Logos—which formed the nuclei of all the “self‐moving” orbs in Kosmos. It is the informing, ever‐present moving‐power and life‐principle, the Vital Soul of the Suns, Moons, Planets, and even of our Earth; the former latent, the latter active—the invisible Ruler and Guide of the gross body attached to, and connected with, its Soul, which is the spiritual emanation, after all, of these respective Planetary Spirits.

>While the absolute equality of the primordial units of mass is thus an essential part of the very foundations of the mechanical theory, the whole modern science of chemistry is based upon a principle directly subversive of it—a principle of which it has recently been said that “it holds the same place in chemistry that the law of gravitation does in astronomy.” This principle is known as the law of Avogadro or Ampère.

>It will be observed that this alphabet has only twentytwo letters, the V and N being duplicated, and that it is arranged in four quinaries, with a quaternary for base and key. The four final letters are two combinations of the duad and the triad, and, read kabbalistically, they form the word AZOTH, by rendering to the shapes of the letters their value in primitive Hebrew, taking N for N, Z as it is in Latin, V for the Hebrew 1 vau, which is pronounced O between two vowels, or letters having the value of vowels, and X for the primitive tau, which had precisely the same figure. The entire Tarot is thus explained in this wonderful medal, which is worthy of Paracelsus, and we hold it at the disposal of the curious. The letters arranged by four times five are summed by the word mZ, analogous to that of mrp, and of INEI, and containing all the mysteries of the Kabbalah.

Without the Tarot, the magic of the ancients is a closed book, and it is impossible to penetrate any of the great mysteries of the Kabbalah.

>Nicholas Flamel belongs to alchemy exclusively, and he enters only into our consideration because of the hieroglyphical book of Abraham the Jew, in which the scrivener of the rue Saint-Jacques-la-Boucherie found the absolute keys of the Great Work. This book was founded on the Keys of the Tarot and was simply a hieroglyphical and Hermetic commentary on the _Sepher Yetzirah_. We find as a fact, by the description of Flamel himself, that the leaves were 21 in number, making 22 with the title, and that they were divided into three septenaries, having a blank leaf at every seventh page. Let us here bear in mind that the Apocalypse, that sublime Kabalistic and prophetic summary of all occult types, also divided its symbols into three septenaries, between each of which there is silence in heaven, thus instituting a striking analogy with the uninscribed leaf in the mystic book of Flamel. The septenaries of the Apocalypse are (_a_) seven seals to open, meaning seven mysteries to be learned and seven difficulties to be overcome; (_b_) seven trumpets to sound, being seven utterances to understand; (_c_) seven vials to empty, which signify seven substances which must be volatilised and fixed.

>Such is the great and sublime revelation of the magi, a revelation which is the mother of all symbols, of all dogmas, of all religions. We can realise already how far Dupuis was mistaken in regarding astronomy as the source of every cultus. It is astronomy, on the contrary, which has sprung from astrology, and primitive astrology is one of the branches of the holy Kabbalah, the science of sciences, and the religion of religions. Hence upon the seventeenth page of the Tarot we find an admirable allegory a naked woman, typifying Truth, Nature, and Wisdom at one and the same time, turns two ewers towards the earth, and pours out fire and water upon it ; above her head glitters the septenary, starred about an eight-pointed star, that of Venus, symbol of peace and love ; the plants of earth are flourishing around the woman, and on one of them the butterfly of Psyche has alighted ; this emblem of the soul is replaced in some copies of the sacred book by a bird, which is a more Egyptian and probably a more ancient symbol. In the modern Tarot the plate is entitled the Glittering Star ; it is analogous to a number of Hermetic symbols, and is also in correspondence with the Blazing Star of Masonic initiates, which expresses most of the mysteries of Eosicrucian secret doctrine.

>These hieroglyphical combinations of letters and numbers belong to the practical part of the kabbalah, which, from this point of view, is divided into Gematriah and Temurah. Such calculations, which now seem to us arbitrary or devoid of interest, then belonged to the philosophical symbolism of the East, and were of the highest importance in the teaching of holy things emanating from the occult sciences. The absolute kabbalistic alphabet, which connected primitive ideas with allegories, allegories with letters, and letters with numbers, was then called the keys of Solomon. We have already stated that these keys, preserved to our own day, but wholly misconstrued, are nothing else than the game of Tarot, the antique allegories of which were remarked and appreciated for the first time in the modern world by the learned archaeologist, Court de Gebelin.

>CHAPTEE THE WE approach the end of our work, and must here give the universal key and utter the final word. The universal key of magical works is the key of all ancient religious dogmas, the key of the Kabbalah and the Bible, the little key of Solomon. Now, this clavicle, regarded as lost for centuries, has been recovered by us, and we have been able to open the sepulchres of the ancient world, to make the dead speak, to behold the monuments of the past in all their splendour, to understand the enigmas of every sphinx, and to penetrate all sanctuaries. Among the ancients the use of this key was permitted to none but the high priests, and even its secret was confided only to the flower of the initiates. Now, this was the key in question: A hieroglyphic and numeral alphabet, expressing by characters and numbers a series of universal and absolute ideas ; then a scale of ten numbers, multiplied by four symbols, and connected with twelve figures representing the twelve signs of the zodiac, plus the four genii of the cardinal points.

>It has been said in the _Doctrine of Transcendental Magic_ that the name Jehovah resolves into seventy-two explicatory names, called _Shemahamphorash_. The art of employing these seventy-two names and discovering therein the keys of universal science is the art which is called by Kabalists the Keys of Solomon. As a fact, at the end of the collections of prayers and evocations which bear this title, there are found usually seventy-two magical circles, making thirty-six talismans, or four times nine, being the absolute number multiplied by the tetrad. Each of these talismans bears two of the two-and-seventy names, the sign emblematical of their number and that of the four letters of Tetragrammaton to which they correspond. From this have originated the four emblematical Tarot suits: the Wand, representing the _Yod_; the Cup, answering to the _He_; the Sword, referable to the _Vau_; and the Pentacle, in correspondence with the final _He_. The complement of the denary has been added in the Tarot, thus repeating synthetically the character of unity.

>The sect of Saint-Jakin was therefore an order of Gnostics steeped in the illusions of the Magic of Fascination; it drew from Rosicrucians and Templars; and its particular name was one of the two names—_Jachin_ and _Boaz_—engraven on the chief pillars of Solomon’s Temple. In Hebrew the initial letter of _Jachin_ is _Yod_, a sacred letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and also the initial of Jehovah, which Divine Name was indeed veiled from the profane under that of _Jachin_, whence the designation Saint-Jakin. The members of this order were theosophists, unwisely addicted to theurgic processes.

>The explanation is that the letter _Aleph_-equivalent to A in Latin, and having the number 1 as its numerical value—signifies the Recipient, the man who is called to initiation, the qualified personality, corresponding to the Bachelor of the Tarot. It signifies also _disciplina_, or dogmatic syllepsis; _Ensoph_, or being in its general and primary conception; and finally, _Kether_, or the Crown, which, in Kabalistic theology, is the first and obscure idea of Divinity.

>The triadic division of our undertaking has been imposed by the science itself, because our discovery of its great mysteries rests entirely upon the significance which the old hierophants attached to numbers. THREE was for them the generating number, and in the exposition of every doctrine they had regard to (_a_) the theory on which it was based, (_b_) its realisation and (_c_) its application to all possible uses. Whether philosophical or religious, thus were dogmas formed; and thus the dogmatic synthesis of that Christianity which was heir of the magi imposes on our faith the recognition of Three Persons in one God and three mysteries in universal religion.

>Saint Martin, in his Natural Table of the Correspondences between God, Man, and the Universe, followed, as we have said, the division of the Tarot, giving an extended mystical commentary upon the twenty-two keys, but he carefully refrained from stating whence he derived his plan, and from revealing the hieroglyphics on which he commented. Postel shewed similar discretion, naming the Tarot only in a diagram of the key to his arcana, and referring to it in the rest of his book under the title of the Genesis of Enoch. The personage of Enoch, author of the primeval sacred book, is in effect identical with that of Thoth among the Egyptians, Cadmus among the Pho3nicians, and Palamedes among the Greeks. We have obtained in an extraordinary manner a sixteenth century medal, which is a key of the Tarot. We scarcely know whether to state that this medal, and the place where it was deposited, were shown us in dream by the divine Paracelsus ; in any case, the medal is in our possession.

For three weeks, during which time the animal magnetism was daily repeated, there was no remarkable difference in his case, but in the fourth week the symptoms of the first degree of magnetism presented themselves, and he was brought to the state of sleeping ; and after the daily repetition of animal magnetism during the space of eight weeks, he recovered without any other phenomenon taking place."*

She was of an exceedingly nervous temperament, very pale, exhausted by former sufferings, and extremely irritable. She had been seized, after a violent fit of anger, with a turning upwards of the eyeballs, in which position they remained fixed, and resisted all sorts of remedies. The idea occurred to M. Sbire, her medical attendant, of trying the application of magnetism. He made the first trial on the 29th of August last, and subsequently repeated it many times. The most remarkable circumstances of this treatment were noted down, and some of them occurred in our own presence. The following is an account of them : —

>After the boys had been dismissed, a girl, apparently of about fourteen years old, was brought forward. She was operated upon in the same manner as had been adopted in the former case. It was about three minutes before any perceptible result was produced ; at the expiration of which period she was in a state of profound and obviously unconscious slumber. It should be stated, that she had been brought into the hospital on account of the loss of all use of the lower extremities, produced by an hysterical affection. She had been treated in the ordinary way without success ; but subsequently to her being magnetised, she had recovered the use of her limbs, and walked unsupported into the room. Two or three attempts were made to rouse her by lifting her arm, pulling her hair, calling her, lifting her off the chair, and placing her upright, but without the least effect. She was then half awakened, or rather thrown into a state of somnambulism, by the operator drawing his thumbs across the eyebrow, from the insertion of the nose outwards ; and in this condition, though still seemingly unconscious, she was able to stand upright. After being kept in this state for a short time, she was again thrown into a sound sleep, and placed in a chair, while the next subject was introduced. In this chair she slept for about an hour and a half, through a hubbub that might have awakened the seven sleepers.

From that day to this, a period of more than a month, the manipulations have been followed by one uniform result — a state of coma (if I may so call it), or profound Mesmeric sleep, coming on gradually after a certain length of time (requiring fifteen or twenty minutes before any effect is observed, and about thirty-five to produce the full effect), the respiration becoming slower, and so gentle as to be quite inaudible ; at length a deep-drawn sigh, followed in about five minutes by a second, after which we find the extremities generally so rigid, that moving one leg moves the whole body. There is also always a great diminution, if not a total absence, of sensibility in the skin, as evinced by the following tests : pinching, pricking, scratching, and tickling, particularly the soles of the feet, which at other times she cannot endure.

M. Guersent pinched his fore-arm so as to leave an ecchymosis. M. Itard leaned upon his thigh with the whole weight of his body.

A fortnight afterwards she had a second ; in her fourteenth year she had a third ; and in her sixteenth year a fourth, when she became so constantly subject to them, that for three months she scarcely passed two days without a fit. During this time many remedies were administered ; at last a seton was applied to the neck, and for the four months it was allowed to remain there she had no recurrence of her fits. The seton had scarcely been removed a fortnight when her fits returned. For one month various remedies were tried, which failing, the seton was re-applied, and worn for seventeen months. During this period many plans of treatment were adopted, and the seton was frequently removed, sometimes accidentally, and sometimes intentionally, in order to observe if the fits would return, which they invariably did. She was subject to the fits even while she wore the seton, if it did not discharge.

>Lastly. On recovering from their somnambulism, they remember nothing which occurred during the magnetic state ; but when again thrown into somnambulism, the memory between the two magnetic states is continuous.

>Hitherto, my attention has been principally confined to the phenomena of insensibility ; but the magnetic action induces other physical phenomena, which are many of them very remarkable. One of these I shall here notice. It is this : — The magnetiser in throwing out the magnetic influence, often causes a sort of electrical shock to pass through the body of the patient, who will start as it were convulsively, or a spasmodic contraction of certain muscles will be visible to all the by-standers. A young girl, or rather a child, for she is not twelve years of age, at this moment attends my demonstrations, who is so susceptible of the magnetic influence, that she almost instantly falls asleep, and the approximation of my fingers towards her, causes a short and quick convulsive start, which seems to pervade her whole frame. In another case, a young lady subjected to fits, experiences under the magnetic action, convulsive motions of the shoulders and chest, which are, however, unattended with pain. A gentleman also, who is to me a stranger, has recently attended at my rooms to be magnetised for a paralysis of the left side of the face, which was caused by an abscess which he suffered from five years ago. Under the magnetical action, the muscles of the face, especially those of the paralysed side, over which he has no command, are visibly contracted ; the angles of his lips are drawn upwards, and his face assumes almost the character of a mask, and this effect is produced when the magnetic passes are made at a distance of ten or twelve feet from him, even though a screen during the operation be interposed between us.* The

>" In some instances," says Loewe, " no other striking phenomena takes place, than merely a gradual change of the unhealthy to the healthy state, according to the repetition of the application. In others the magnetised person falls asleep, and is recovered without being brought to a higher degree of magnetical phenomena. The four following cases have come under my own observation : — At Groningen, a girl, about nineteen years of age, was suffering under hysterical spasms, which sometimes continued for forty-eight hours : after being magnetised half an hour a day for three weeks, the patient recovered, and no other phenomena was effected.
## 39: Denis (1838) 446 [9e-04]

>The duration of the attack at this time, if left uncontrolled, was usually two and a half to three hours, when she gradually became quieter, though she still continued muttering, and at length became sensible, without, however, having once closed her eyes.

>Her susceptibility was now so great, that she heard and felt what happened at a distance ; and was so sensible to magnetic influences, that the nails in the walls annoyed her, and they were obliged to remove them. Neither could she endure any light.

>A. No. The first marked physical sensation is an irritation of the same convulsive movements. The patient was in a short time put asleep, after which, in order to remove every suspicion of any previous understanding between him and the operator, the commissioners handed to M. Dupotet a note, written at the moment, wherein they had specified the parts they wished to be convulsed. Possessed of this instruction, M. Dupotet first directed his hand towards the right wrist, which immediately became convulsed ; he then stood behind the patient and directed his finger first towards the left thigh, then towards the left elbow, and lastly, towards the head. Each of these parts were almost immediately seized with convulsive movements. M. Dupotet then the diseased muscles of the face, and, almost at the same time, a convulsive closing of the eyes. Nearly the same results are experienced when I am magnetised upon the feet.

## 43: Denis (1838) 233 [4e-04]

>M. de Puysegur further adds, " If, when magnetising a patient, you perceive that he experiences a certain numbness, or slight spasm, attended with nervous shocks ; and should you then observe that he closes his eyes, you must rub them lightly with your thumbs to prevent the convulsive winking of the eyelids. You will know that your patient is in the magnetic sleep when you see him sensible to your action when you hold your thumb opposite to the plexus. A patient, in his crisis, should answer no one but his magnetiser, and allow nobody else to touch him."
## 44: Denis (1838) 46 [1e-04]

>" We were first of all desirous of ascertaining whether the individual presented to us by M. Dupotet, whose good faith was perfectly well known to us, was the identical person who, nine years before, had been magnetised at the Hotel-Dieu. MM. Bricheteau and Patissier, who had been present at those experiments, had the goodness to comply with the request of the committee, and, conjointly with the reporter, certified by a document which they signed, that it was the same person who had been the subject of the experiments made in the Hotel-Dieu in 1820, and that they perceived no change in her beyond that which indicated a sensible amelioration of her health. The identity having been thus verified, Mademoiselle Samson was magnetised by M. Dupotet, in presence of the committee. The manipulations had scarcely commenced, when Mademoiselle Samson became restless, rubbed her eyes, expressed impatience, complained, coughed with a hoarse voice, which recalled to the recollection of MM. Bricheteau, Patissier, and the reporter, the same sound of voice which had struck them in 1820, and which then, as upon the present occasion, pointed out to them the commencement of the magnetic action. Soon after, she stamped with her foot, supported her head upon her right hand, which rested upon the elbow-chair, and appeared to fall asleep. We raised her eyelids, and perceived, as in 1820, the ball of the eye turned convulsively upwards. Several questions were addressed to her, and remained unanswered ; then, when new ones were put, she exhibited signs of impatience, and said with ill humour that we ought not to annoy her. At length, without having intimated his intention to any one, the reporter threw down upon the floor a table and a billet of wood which he had placed upon it. Some of those present uttered a cry of terror, — Mademoiselle Samson, alone, heard nothing, made no sort of motion, and continued to sleep after as before the sudden and violent noise. She was awakened, four minutes afterwards, by rubbing her eyes in a circular manner with the thumbs. The same billet was then suddenly thrown upon the floor ; the noise made her start now that she was awake, and she complained bitterly of the fright that had been given her, although six minutes before she had been insensible to a much greater noise."

>But notwithstanding these observations of the learned Baron, the psychical phenomena exhibited by natural somnambulists are often of so high and lucid a character, that the two states appear almost identical with each other ; in illustration of which I shall here quote the case of a girl named Arron, a remarkable natural somnambulist, which will be found in the Journal de laMeuse for the 20th of September, 1835.

>From this Mesmeric sleep she commonly awakens in about three hours, quite sensible. I should here say, that the above phenomena have as frequently been produced by my pupil, Mr. W. Whitehouse, as by myself ; indeed it was he who first, by persevering for about fifty minutes, produced the marked effects above described, though I had several times previously observed a slight and transient drowsiness or quietude result from a few passes.

It is beneficial occasionally to move your fingers on the sides, and especially in the region of the spleen. After having continued this exercise for about a quarter of an hour, you should change your mode of operating, according to the state of the patient.

>" Pierre Cazot, aged twenty years, by trade a hatter, born of an epileptic mother, had been subject for ten years to attacks of epilepsy, which occurred five or six times a week, when he was admitted into the Hopital de la Charite, about the beginning of the month of August, 1827. He was immediately subjected to the magnetic treatment, was set asleep at the third sitting, and became somnambulist at the tenth, which took place upon the 19th of August. It was then, at nine o'clock in the morning, that he announced to us that at four o'clock of the afternoon of that day he should have an attack of epilepsy, but that it might be prevented by magnetising him a little previously. We preferred verifying the exactness of his prediction, and no precaution was taken to prevent its fulfilment. We contented ourselves with observing him, without exciting in him any suspicion. At one o'clock, he was seized with a violent head-ache. At three, he was obliged to go to bed, and precisely at four the fit came on. It lasted five minutes."

He then directed his foot towards the right elbow of M. Petit, which became violently agitated ; he then stretched his foot towards the left hand and elbow, and violent convulsive movements developed themselves in the upper limbs. One of the commissioners, M. Marc, with the intention of obviating more effectually every possibility of deception, blindfolded the patient, and the preceding experiments were repeated, with a slight difference in the result. MM. Thillay and Marc directed their fingers toward different parts of the body, and provoked some conas when you are not under the magnetic influence, or do they appear as if seen through some different or new medium?

>Persons very susceptible to electrical influences are often cured of their maladies by a change of residence ; whilst others of the same description, frequently from a like cause, fall into sicknesses which the physician cannot account for. Papponi, a man spoken of by Amoretti, who was very susceptible to electrical influences, and who suffered from convulsions, was cured merely by a change of residence. Pennet, a man of the same susceptibility, could not go to rest^ in a certain inn in Calabria, till he had wrapt himself in an isolating cloak of waxed cloth.

>" Hannah Hunter, aged thirteen, was admitted the beginning of last month, having lost the use of her legs entirely, and being unable even to sit up in a chair. The treatment adopted was tonics, cold shower-baths, and electricity. After these remedies had been persevered in for about three weeks, she so far improved as to be able to sit up ; but was still unable to stand alone. On the two first occasions of being Mesmerised, drowsiness only was produced ; the third time the peculiar sleep caused by this process was induced and removed at pleasure. After this had been continued for a few days, all the other means of treatment were omitted, the sleep was induced every day, and allowed to continue an hour or two. For a few days there was no apparent change ; but after that she began to improve, her strength increased in proportion as the paralysis subsided, and she is now able to stand very well, and even to walk with very trifling assistance."*

>When natural somnambulists are awakened from this state, it is a curious fact, that they remember nothing which has taken place during their somnambulism ; but when they again fall into the same state, they then recollect everything which occurred in their former fits. The links of the chain are, as it were, re-united, and the memory of one somnambulic state is as continuous with that of the next as if no interval had elapsed between them. In Moritz' Psychological Magazine, Ritter relates the case of a boy ten years of age, who became subject to fits of drowsiness, and fell suddenly asleep whether standing or sitting. In this state he would converse with persons around him, and although his eyes were completely closed, he was able to see and discriminate all objects presented to him. When awakened, he would recollect nothing that had occurred during his sleep, but would talk of other matters. On his again falling asleep, he would resume the thread of his discourse where it had been previously interrupted ; and again, when he awoke, remembered nothing of the conversation which had taken place during his sleep, although he recollected what had been last said to him when awake. The rule indeed, is, that if somnambulists remember, either distinctly or indistinctly, anything which occurred during their somnambulic state, their somnambulism has been imperfect; and so also in ordinary sleep, the non-recollection or the recollection of our dreams may be esteemed a criterion of our sleep having been more or less profound.

>The first case was one of epilepsy, occurring in a girl sixteen years of age, a housemaid of diminutive stature. She had been subject for twelve months before her admission, on the 4th of April, 1837, to attacks of epilepsy, which occurred about once a week, or oftener. At twelve years of age she had a fall, by which she was stunned : this was worthy of remembrance. She was subject to almost constant headaches in the morning and evening ; they also came on a short time previous >to the occurrence of a fit, and sometimes shooting pains across the occiput preceded the fit for a few days. She also experienced before the fit came on a sensation of coldness, which ran up the spine, and was attended with numbness, which, when it reached the head, produced the feeling of her being stunned, and then she lost consciousness. The fit was characterised by convulsions, chiefly of the face and trunk; the extremities were in a rigid state, the hands clenched, the face variously contorted, the eyes rolled. This state was not followed by coma, but with a restlessness and sleeplessness, and a severe throbbing pain of the head, which generally continued for three or four hours, She had been cupped on the shoulders last January, and had leeches applied to the temples, and took some aperient medicine. She had a fit last night ; the fits usually come on in bed during the state intermediate between sleeping and waking. Complained on her admission of headache, and sickness after food ; tongue clean, appetite bad, bowels regular.

>Quinine was now used, grs.ij. every four hours, and grs.vj. an hour before the attack ; this had the effect of shortening the fit and making it later every night, until at last, after intermitting one evening, it left altogether. The attack lasted twelve days ; but one fit, produced by excitement, occurred five nights after.

>A. I appear, as I have before said, to receive a coldness, which quickly operates to the expulsion of heat from the interior ; being magnetised for some time, and all things being quiet, this heat is accompanied by great perspiration at all the extremities; for instance, the hands and the feet.

>" The president of the committee, M. Bourdois, ascertained that the number of pulsations diminished at the rate of twenty-two in a minute, and that there was even some irregularity in the pulse. M. Dupotet after having put a bandage upon the eyes of the somnambulist, repeatedly directed towards him the points of his fingers, at the distance of about two feet. Immediately a violent contraction was perceived in the hands and arms towards which the action was directed. M. Dupotet having, in a similar manner, approximated his feet to those of M. Petit, always without contact, the latter quickly withdrew his. He complained of great pain and a burning heat in the limbs, towards which the action had been directed. M. Bourdois endeavoured to produce the same effects ; and he succeeded, but less promptly, and in a more feeble degree. This point being established, we proceeded to ascertain the lucidity (clairvoyance) of the somnambulist. He having declared that he could not see with the bandage, it was taken off ; but then we determined to assure ourselves that the eyelids were exactly closed. For this purpose, a candle was almost constantly held, during the experiments, before the eyes of M. Petit, at a distance of one or two inches ; and several persons had their eyes continually fixed upon his. None of us could perceive the slightest separation of the eyelids. Mr. Ribes, indeed, remarked that their edges were super-imposed, so that the eye-lashes crossed each other.

His wish was complied with, and another was put in his place, who was equally a stranger to the circumstances. Three nights he passed without any disturbance ; but on the next, being quite awake, he felt all at once a weight upon his breast, like a sack, and some one seemed to blow in his ear. The same thing frequently occurred afterwards. The quilt was also often drawn off the bed, and when he attempted to catch at it, he found himself unable to move his arms.

>This state of insensibility, accompanied by somnambulic phenomena, sometimes arises spontaneously, and without any ostensible magnetic intervention. " I lately," says Dr. Abercrombie, the present eminent physician in Edinburgh, had u under my care a lady who is liable to an affection of this kind (somnambulism), which comes on repeatedly during the day, and continues from ten minutes to an hour at a time. Without any warning, her body becomes motionless, her eyes open, fixed, and entirely insensible, and she becomes totally unconscious of any external impression. She has been frequently seized while playing on the piano, and has continued to play over and over a part of a tune with perfect correctness, but without advancing beyond a certain point. On one occasion she was seized after she had begun to play from the book a piece of music which was new to her. During the paroxysm she continued the part she had played, and repeated it five or six times with perfect correctness ; but on coming out of the attack, she could not play it without her book.*

>Bertrand relates the case of a lady, Mademoiselle A., who exhibited a remarkable singularity as to the way in which she received sensations either by the pit of the stomach, fingers, or toes. When an odorous substance was applied to the tips of the fingers, she cried " Ah que cela sent bon !" and at the same time she inhaled the air with her nostrils. It was the same in respect to sight ; when an object was placed on the palm of the hand, the soles of the feet, or the epigastrium, if she said, " Je ne vois pas bien," she rubbed her eyes with her hand, as if awake.*

>Here, therefore, in the presence of many highly-distinguished visitors, I daily pursue my demonstrations — here I have convinced many of the real existence of the magnetic influence, nay, on several occasions, have magnetised the sceptics themselves, — and here I have succeeded (which is to me a more gratifying reflection) in alleviating the sufferings of many persons afflicted with chronic nervous complaints, which had resisted every ordinary method of medical treatment.

>He then describes the proceedings employed by M. de Puysegur for acting upon the patients ; and having related various scenes of magnetisation, adds — " The consummation of this state (the magnetic state) is an appearance of sleep, during which the physical faculties seem to be suspended, but to the advantage of the intellectual faculties. The eyes of the subject are closed ; his sense of hearing is abolished ; he wakes only at the sight of the master {du mattre.) No one should touch the patient during a crisis, not even the chair on which he is seated ; it would cause him much suffering and convulsions, which the master only can calm."
## 72: Denis (1838) 416 [6e-04]

>2. It has been proved that persons in proximity with those who are being magnetised not unfrequently receive the magnetic influence indirectly, and without any intention or consent on the part of the magnetiser. This can only arise from their being incidentally placed within the sphere of a material effluence ; for here, on the part of the magnetiser, no psychical cause is in operation.
## 73: Denis (1838) 267 [1e-04]

>The magnetic influence, when thus communicated, instead of inducing sleep, generally gives rise to spasms, convulsions, and alarming symptoms. On another occasion, I was magnetising a lady who was but little sensible of the magnetic influence^ when a person who stood beside her felt, during the operation, her limbs benumbed, and pricking pains in her eyelids. On the following day the same lady was again magnetised, without the intention of producing an effect on any one else ; but the same attendant again experienced symptoms more decided than on the preceding day, and remained the whole of that day afterwards in a state of excessive lassitude. Again, at the next seance she was affected so much that somnambulism was brought on, and yet I had no intention of producing this result. She soon awoke ; but, yielding to sleep again, she remained in this state for several hours. A similar incident occurred to me while operating at the house of a patient of mine, the wife of a counsellor of state. Her lady's-maid, who attended the sitting to render assistance if necessary, was seized, while I was magnetising her mistress, with severe spasms, which soon became very alarming. I rose to subdue them, but she hurried away, declaring that I gave her pain, and that she would not allow me to come near her. She, however, soon recovered, and I attributed the effects only to an excited imagination. When perfectly recomposed, she sat down again near to her mistress, upon whom I recommenced the magnetic operation as before. But in about five minutes, and without any intention on my part to exert any influence on this attendant, she was again seized with the same description of paroxysm, accompanied with considerable pain and difficulty of breathing, from which she did not recover for several days afterwards.
## 74: Denis (1838) 455 [6e-04]

>The same results have uniformly followed the Mesmerism if practised in the day-time, independently of the attack, or of catheterism — the same succession of symptoms — the same insensibility to external impressions. It, however, requires less time to effect this — twenty to twenty-five minutes being sufficient. From this day-sleep she awakes in about three hours, much refreshed.

>In her subsequent paroxysms, she began to understand what was said to her, and to answer with a considerable degree of consistency," &c. " She also became capable of following her usual employments during the paroxysm ; at one time she laid out the table correctly for breakfast, and repeatedly dressed herself and the children of the family, her eyes remaining shut the whole time. The remarkable circumstance was now discovered, that, during the paroxysm, she had a distinct recollection of what took place in former paroxysms, though she had no remembrance of it during the intervals. At one time, she was taken to church while under the attack, and there behaved with propriety, evidently attending to the preacher ; and she was at one time so much affected as to shed tears. In the interval, she had no recollection of having been at church ; but, in the next paroxysm, she gave a most distinct account of the sermon, and mentioned particularly the part of it by which she had been so much affected." — "During the attack, her eye-lids were generally half shut ; her eyes sometimes resembled those of a person affected with amaurosis, — that is, with a dilated and insensible state of the pupil ; but sometimes they were quite natural." — " At one time, during the attack, she read distinctly a portion of a book which was presented to her : and she often sung, both sacred and common pieces, incomparably better, Dr. Dyce affirms, than she could do in the waking state."*
## 78: Denis (1838) 297 [1e-04]

>In a letter, dated Lyons, 1784, which appeared in a work entitled, Reflexions Impartiales sur le Magnetisme, it is stated : — " The following experiment has often been repeated. A very susceptible somnambula was left in a room with other persons endeavouring to engage her attention, during which time she was, without her knowledge, magnetised from the next room, and the effect was as prompt and nearly as powerful as if the magnetiser had been close to her ; the only difference observable was that, not being aware that she was under the magnetic influence, she at first endeavoured to counteract the sensations she experienced, mistaking what she felt for a natural uneasiness, and she only gave way to it when the magnetic action, increasing in power, forced upon her the consciousness that she was being magnetised. A single experiment would not have been decisive ; but by repeating the operation results have been obtained more or less characterised according to the degree of sensibility in the person magnetised." The report of the <e Academie de Medecine" also contains a case of magnetic action at a distance, which was proved to the conviction of the commissioners — " On the 10th of September, 1827, at seven o'clock in the evening, the commissioners," says the reporter, " met at the residence of M. Itard, who continued his experiments on Cazot. The latter was in the room where a conversation was kept up with him till half-past seven, when M. Foissac, who had entered after him, and remained in a parlour separated from the above room by two doors well closed, and at a distance of twelve feet, began to magnetise him. Three minutes after, Cazot said : — * I think M. Foissac is there, for I feel quite giddy.' In the course of eight minutes he was in a profound sleep."
## 79: Denis (1838) 210 [3e-04]

>" Another very singular phenomenon presented by some instances . of this affection, is what has been called, rather incorrectly, a state of double consciousness. It consists in the individual recollecting, during a paroxysm, circumstances which occurred in a former attack, though there was no remembrance of them during the interval. This, as well as various other phenomena connected with the affection, is strikingly illustrated in a case described by Dr. Dyce, of Aberdeen, in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions. The patient was a servant girl, and the affection began with fits of somnolency, which came upon her suddenly during the day, and from which she could at first be roused by shaking, or by being taken out into the open air. She soon began to talk a great deal during the attacks regarding things which seemed to be passing before her as a dream ; and she was not, at this time, sensible of anything that was said to her.

>" A lady residing in London, after a violent attack of fever, under which she was suffering in the months of December and January last, was affected by convulsions of every kind, but mostly by fainting, which often lasted two hours, and it was difficult to bring her to herself. I was one day present when this fainting was coming on, and, in presence of her sister and brother-in-law, I tried to make application of animal magnetism : I had scarcely begun to operate, when she quickly recovered from the fainting, as though she had been awakened by fright, and from that moment she gradually recovered, with the assistance of medicaments usual in such cases, and is now in perfect health.

>M. Joseph Skrodzki, captain, aged 21, having been seized with an attack of St. Vitus' dance, was treated by the doctors of Besancon, who cauterised his arms and lumbar region, and bled him several times. Having found that the antiphlogistic treatment, and various medicaments prescribed in similar cases, had produced no change for the better, they advised him to take a trip to Paris. He accordingly came to the capital, and was admitted at the hospital de la Pitie, where he was again bled and subjected to applications of moxa at the nape of the neck. All these means were prescribed and strictly adhered to without producing any remarkable amelioration of health. The patient then applied to me, as he had before been under my care ; but his state did not allow me to give him a favourable prognosis ; I proposed, however, to treat him magnetically for a fortnight, that I might then be enabled to pronounce whether it was in my power to cure him. He had left the hospital de la Pitie in the month of July, 1832. I began to apply magnetism immediately on his leaving. At the first sitting, the paroxysms which had occurred in the early part of the day no longer returned ; they were confined to the prodromes ; during the subsequent days, the prodromes were less frequent. On the seventh day the captain was perfectly cured, and the parts which were in a purulent state were healed by a lotion of magnetised water.

>I explained to him, without reserve, that, for ordinary maladies, I had little confidence in the prescriptions of sleep wakers; but that, in the case of the Countess — which seemed to me to be not altogether mania, but to have some resemblance to a state of magnetic dreaming — the experiment would be worth making.

>" But if sight be obliterated in its natural organ, it is satisfactorily demonstrated by me that it may exist in various parts of the body. The following is an experiment I have often repeated. It was performed in the presence of M. Ferrus. I took my watch and held it at the back of the head, at a distance of three or four inches from the occiput. I asked the somnambule whether she saw anything. 4 Certainly,' said she, ' I see something shining ; it gives me pain.' Her countenance was expressive of pain ; and ours bespoke our astonishment. We stared at each other, and M. Ferrus at last broke silence, by observing to me, that if she could see something shine she could probably tell what it was.

>The Mesmeric trance may exist in two degrees, one analogous to sleep, the other analogous to somnambulism. Dr. Elliotson, on the occasions to which I advert, exhibited three patients, girls, of ages between thirteen and seventeen, who displayed in succession these two states, alternating with each other, or with the rational waking state, at the pleasure of the operator. These two states may be called Mesmeric coma, and Mesmeric sleeping-walking. — Mesmeric coma is a state of profound insensibility, in which the pulse is slightly quickened, the breathing gentle and natural, the pupil as ordinarily, but turned up or rolling away when the eyelids are opened, contracting on exposure to light. The insensibility is so profound as not to be disturbed by a strong electric shock, or by the sustained action of a magneto-galvanic battery, each so intense as to be intolerable to most persons. It should be mentioned that the muscles were convulsed under the influence of the galvanic discharge, while it appeared to be unfelt by the patient. The lesser stimuli of pinching or pricking the skin, or pulling the hair, produce no effect whatever. It is not to be doubted that any surgical operation might be performed upon a person in this state without her feeling it. — In Mesmeric sleep-walking, the patient is to a certain degree awake to external objects, and is able to support herself, and to walk about, but with hesitation and insecurity : she sees, but the eyes remain fixed for distant vision, so that objects close at hand appear double : she hears, but has no perception of the direction of sound, so that she does not turn her head to one addressing her standing by her side ; if the voice is a familiar one, she recognises it, and is anxious to know where the person is, and looks in search of the person, but looks straight before her only. The insensibility to touch is as great as in the Mesmeric coma : neither pinching the skin, nor pulling the hair, nor touching the surface of the eye, nor the electric or galvanic shock, provoke sensation any more than in the former state. Whether the muscular sense, and taste, and smell, are suspended, is not yet ascertained. Dr. Elliotson inclines to think that the former is preserved ; Mr. Wheatstone is of opinion that, together with taste and smell, the muscular sense is temporarily extinguished. Citric acid, and soda, which Mr. Wheatstone placed on the tongue successively, seemed to excite no sensation. Snuff does not produce sneezing. But one of these little patients, having two different weights placed in her hands, lifted more readily, and said that it was easier to lift the lighter than the heavier. The extent to which reflection and volition are awake in this state, appears to differ in different individuals. Two of the three young patients talk fluently, with great readiness of apprehension and reply, and some humour, in the state of somnambulism ; the other, who is younger, and when awake, of a more quiet and gentle disposition, hardly answers more than yes or no. The difference probably has to do with two causes : one, natural character, the other, the passing or permanent tendency to ordinary somnambulism and fits of delirium. One of the three patients shewn by Dr. Elliotson, after being thrown into the Mesmeric coma, spontaneously and suddenly awakes into the state of somnambulism, with an appearance of pleasure and delight at her returned consciousness, and instantly begins addressing observations to persons or objects around her. One of the two others requires to be artificially, and by a peculiar manipulation, aroused from the state of coma into that of somnambulism. The period in which one or both of the others would remain in the state of coma seems to be indefinite. Dr. Elliotson mentioned that one had been kept in this state twenty hours. With the state denoted by the term " Mesmeric coma" I know no spontaneous disorder of the system that has been proved to be identical ; but it is highlyprobable that in some other trances, and in some hysteric fits, insensibility as profound exists " When the state of coma supervenes, the iris contracts, as it does when one drops asleep ; but the contraction is transient, and goes away suddenly. It may be seen coming on for three or four seconds, while the coma is supervening ; the moment that is complete, the pupil becomes natural again, and maintains the same degree of contraction or dilatation as under the same light in the waking state. From the state of coma, it has been mentioned that one, if not two, of Dr. Elliotson's patients, spontaneously, in about a minute, wakes into the Mesmeric somnambulism. In the others, or in one of them certainly, this change does not take place spontaneously. To produce it a manipulation is used, which is equally effective with all three. If with both thumbs the eyebrows are once or twice strongly rubbed from the nose outwards, the little patient opens her eyes, and is at once in the state of somnambulism above described, and can hear and speak. A similar manipulation used on the forehead, or the cheek, or the chin, is totally useless, and the patient is left in the same state of coma as before. The same manipulation continued longer, restores the patient to perfect waking and the natural condition of the mind and body. When she is in the state of somnambulism, the least motion directed towards the patient by any spectator, not only when near, but when several feet off, instantly produces the state of coma. This effect takes place with more certainty if the motion is in front of the patient. Not only on moving the hand downwards, but on bowing, or on raising the foot before the patient, with a direction towards her, she drops into total unconsciousness. The coma is produced with equal certainty if a thick screen of board is interposed between the operator and the patient, as if he is standing immediately before and seen by her ; but the effect does not then ensue as soon as otherwise. One mode of inducing the state of coma upon somnambulism is to blow upon the patient's eyelids. What makes this effect the more singular is, that when the patient has thus been rendered comatose, blowing upon the eyelids awakens her into somnambulism ; so the patient's sleep-walking senses may be blown out, and afterwards blown in again.

>She was now placed under the care of Dr. B., suffering dreadful spasms and anxieties ; she existed only through the nervous emanations of others, and it became necessary that some one should always hold her hand ; and if the person was weak, it increased her debility. The physician prescribed magnetic passes and medicines ; but she fell into the magnetic sleep, and prescribed for herself. Her greatest suffering arose from the sensation of having a stone in her head ; it seemed as if her brain was compressed, and at every breath she drew, the motion pained her. This sensation disturbed her sleep, which lasted only as long as a hand was laid on her forehead. At this time an experiment was made by applying a magnet to her forehead ; immediately her head and face were turned rounds and her mouth was distorted^ as by a stroke of palsy. These symptoms continued two days, after which they disappeared of themselves.

>" While M. Petit was engaged in a second game at piquet, M. Dupotet, upon the suggestion of M. Ribes, directed his hand, from behind, towards the patient's elbow, and the contraction previously observed again took place. Afterwards, upon the suggestion of M. Bourdois, he magnetised him from behind, and always at the distance of more than a foot, with the intention of awakening him. The keenness with which the somnambulist was engaged in play, resisted this action, which, without awakening, seemed to annoy and disconcert him. He carried his hand several times to the back of his head, as if he suffered pain in that part. At length he fell into a state of somnolency, which seemed like a slight natural sleep ; and some one having spoken to him when in this state> he awoke as if with a start. A few moments afterwards, M. Dupotet, always placed near him, but at a certain distance, set him again asleep, and we recommenced our experiments. M. Dupotet being desirous that not the slightest shadow of doubt should remain with regard to the nature of the physical influence exerted at will upon the somnambulist, proposed to place upon M. Petit as many bandages as we might think proper, and to operate upon him while in this state. In fact, we covered his face down to the nostrils with several neckcloths ; we stopped up with gloves the cavities formed by the prominence of the nose, and we covered the whole with a black handkerchief, which descended, in the form of a veil, as far as the neck. The attempts to excite the magnetic susceptibility, by operating at a distance in every way, were then renewed; and, invariably, the same motions were perceived in the parts towards which the hand or the foot were directed.

>A child, eight years old, without any known cause, was seized with ascitis, and afterwards with an ulcer in the right leg. The physician who attended wished to perform the operation of paracentesis, and, with this view, applied to me for advice. I proposed to defer the operation for a few days, and to submit the child to the magnetic treatment, to which they acquiesced. As early as the second day of magnetisation, the evacuations became more abundant than they had been during the application of the remedies, which had been previously exhibited with this intent. After the third, fourth, and fifth sittings, the patient became still more improved, and by the twentieth day was perfectly cured.

>The next proces-verbal I shall cite was deposited at the office of JVL Dubois, a well-known notary, at Paris, and refers to a case which was witnessed by MM. Husson, Bricheteau, Delens, and other eminent physicians. But before proceeding, it may be necessary so far to anticipate the psychical details as to observe that the individual in this somnambulic state will often exclaim aloud, converse, sing, and perform a variety of actions, as persons addicted to spontaneous or natural' somnambulism often do, only in a much more perfect or lucid manner. There is also a peculiar relation established between the magnetiser and the magnetisee ; they are said to be en rapport with each other ; in other words, the magnetic sleeper, while absolutely insensible to all other external impressions? is mentally conscious of every act of the magnetiser ; he will hear, even at a distance, the slightest modulation of his voice, however inaudible it may be to those around ; but the power of the magnetiser over the magnetisee will be hereafter more fully described. To return, therefore, to the proces-verbal now cited : " Catherine Samson (a young girl of much natural timidity) was put to sleep in about fifteen minutes. Many persons present endeavoured to rouse her by individually, and then altogether, screaming suddenly in her ears. They also struck violently with their clenched fists various pieces of furniture, but could not obtain any symptom of her hearing the loudest noise. 7th September, 1820. She fell asleep in three minutes ; M. Recamier opened her eyelids, shook her violently, grasped her hands violently, struck the table with all his might, pinched her repeatedly, raised her from her seat and suddenly let her fall, — still no change was perceptible, nothing which could convey an idea that the patient either heard or felt. When the magnetiser, however, spoke, c ;he heard him distinctly. M. Recamier then alternated his voice with that of the magnetiser, but to his voice she was insensible. 10th of November. The patient fell asleep in one minute. Her lips and nostrils were tickled with feathers, yet she felt nothing. They cried out that she was an impostor, that her conduct was scandalous, and tha f ^they would kick her out of the room. Some counterfeited the voice of the magnetiser, but could obtain no answer, nor was any alteration visible in the expression of her countenance. 10th November ; evening. She was magnetised in her bed ; in a few minutes fell asleep, and remained all night in a somnambulic state. The persons appointed to watch her observed that she never moved ; they pulled and plucked out the hair of her head by the roots, but could detect no sign of sensation."

>" During all this time, we never ceased to examine the eyes, and to hold a candle near them ; and we always found them exactly closed. We remarked, however, that the ball of the eye seemed to move under the eyelids, and to follow the different motions of the hands. Finally, M. Bourdois declared, that, according to all human probability, and as far as it was possible to judge by the senses, the eyelids were exactly closed.

>My friend, Dr Off, of Lbwenstein, agreed with me in opinion, and we commenced a regular course of treatment ; but we were disappointed. Dysentery, spasms, nightsweats, still continued ; her gums became scorbutic, bled constantly, and she lost all her teeth. By giving her tonics, a feeling was induced as if she was lifted into the air; she was afraid of everybody, and at night was often attacked by a deathlike debility.

>The same thing happens with a certain secretion, which is supposed to be facilitated or retarded by certain processes, whereas the result often proves the reverse of what was intended. So, also, in endeavouring to awake a somnambule, I remember often having been much perplexed ; for it is an established rule among magnetisers, that a somnambulist be awakened by transverse manipulations over his eyes and face. But it has often occurred to me that I have been unable to awaken, and obliged to leave the somnambulist in his sleep, notwithstanding I had employed all the means prescribed in similar cases. In vain have I rubbed the eyelids, even so much as to produce ecchymosis on this very sensible part ; still sleep continued much beyond the period I had assigned ; and what is still more remarkable, its intensity was greater than when the regular magnetic sleep had not been disturbed.

>Here, also, is another extract from the Gazette Medicale de Paris, dated October 2, 1832 : — " There is now observed, at the Hospital Delia Vitta, in Bologna, a very extraordinary phenomenon of animal magnetism. In this hospital is a patient, who is seized every third day, precisely at eleven in the morning, with a convulsion so violent that he loses entirely the faculty of perceiving sensations. Sight, hearing, and smelling, totally disappear ; the organs of the senses cease their functions ; both his hands are so firmly clenched that it is impossible to open them, and by using more force the fingers would certainly break. But Dr. Cini, son of the artist of that name, under whose care he was placed, discovered, after long and attentive observations, that the epigastrium,* at about one inch above the umbilicus, received, during the convulsive fit, all the perceptions of the senses, so as to replace them to a certain extent. If we speak to the patient, touching the epigastrium with the finger, he answers immediately ; and if requested to do so, he will of his own accord open his hands ; if a body be placed upon the epigastrium the patient describes its shape, smell, quality, and colour. During the contact of the finger the convulsion gradually diminishes, and seems to die away ; but if the finger be placed upon the heart, the convulsion revives, and lasts as long as the finger remains in this position. If a flute be played upon while touching the epigastrium, the patient hears the music, and when, without interrupting the performance on the instrument, the finger leaves the epigastrium to touch the precordial region, and then returns to the epigastrium, the patient inquires why the musical performance is now and then interrupted. These experiments were performed in the beginning of September, in the presence of both professors and students ; and they excited the greatest surprise."

>* In the early part of this volume a variety of experiments are reported — many of which, it must be admitted, were very cruel— to establish beyond a doubt the absolute insensibility of the persons operated upon; but none of these perhaps even equalled in intensity that described in the above case, of a magnetised patient being subjected to the shock of a galvanic battery without manifesting the slightest sensation. This, too, was an experiment performed in one of the public hospitals in London, in the presence of many witnesses, not one of whom probably, at the time, believed even in any of the subordinate phenomena of Animal Magnetism.

>Many persons thought, that this ghostseeing, on the part of Mrs. H , originated with me, and those about her ; but Mrs. H was not like some dependent somnambules I have seen ; she stood alone. 8he appeared, to those who knew and understood her, as a very sensible woman, in a very abnormal state.

>To this testimony of M. Bouillet, may be added that of M. Husson, President of the Academy of Medicine, who, in his address to that learned Society, observes, — " The operator has succeeded, during this singular state (somnambulism), in producing paralysis, or so entirely closing the senses against all external impressions, that a bottle containing several ounces of concentrated ammonia was held immediately under the nostrils, for five, ten, fifteen minutes, or more, without producing the slightest effect; without impeding respiration, or provoking sternutation. The skin was perfectly insensible, even when pinched so as to leave black marks ; nay, it was absolutely insensible to the burning of moxa, and to the acute irritation of hot water strongly impregnated with mustard, although when the skin recovered its normal state, the pain thereby caused was intensely felt." The authority of Dr. Bertrand may be cited to the same effect. " I saw," he observes, " insensibility so decidedly manifested in certain magnetic somnambules, that it could be proved by the most conclusive tests. I saw a magnetiser who used to put his somnambules to sleep before a numerous assembly, and entreat every person present to provide himself with a pin, and thrust them all unexpectedly, at the same moment, into different parts of the body. Accordingly, while the somnambulist was on one occasion singing, forty or fifty pins were thus thrust simultaneously into his flesh without causing the least appreciable alteration in his voice."

>There are many persons naturally very susceptible of the magnetic influence. They cannot endure the operation when steadily and vigorously conducted ; the accumulation of the magnetic fluid in their system produces an alarming disturbance of all the organic functions ; the action of the heart becomes increased, the breathing hurried, violent convulsive fits supervene ; and should such persons be labouring under any aneurismal affection, disposition to apoplexy, or far advanced phthisical diseases, the consequences may be fatal. As a general rule, the susceptibility of the patient increases with every successive sitting. He who at first resisted the operation for a considerable time, at length speedily, even in a few seconds, falls into somnambulism ; and when the magnetiser has invested him with an extreme aptitude to pass from one state to another, the least gesture from him — a look indicative of his intention — his will expressed with energy, is sufficient. It should also be observed, that during natural sleep persons are magnetised with as much, or perhaps more, facility than when awake. Under the magnetic influence they soon become restless and agitated, and the natural passes into the magnetic sleep, characterised by all the phenomena which are so peculiar to this state of being.

>" Artificial or magnetic somnambulism," says he, " is the result of certain processes, consisting in gestures, manipulations, and acts of volition, operating on persons susceptible of exhibiting its phenomena ; it is, as it were, inoculated by the magnetiser. The natural state of the patient submitted to his action when susceptible of receiving it, is generally separated from the subsequent magnetic state by a somnolence of a few minutes. In the crisis a great number of faculties lie dormant, which has caused animal magnetism to retain the name of somnambulism, although magnetism may sometimes be induced without sleep.

>Now, they (the students) were aware, that when affections of this nature attacked persons while asleep, and they were partially awakened, the state they were then in was called somnambulism; but when the attacks came on while the persons were awake, and they became half asleep, the result was ecstacy. The one term he had employed, that of " sleep-waking," applied to both these states. Sleep-waking was much more extraordinary in some persons than in others. This patient recollected in one paroxysm what occurred in former ones, but when out of the attacks she forgot all that took place in them. She had a memory of circumstances which happened in the fits during the presence of the fits only ; but she also remembered in the fits those things which occurred out of them. The eyes of this patient converged towards the nose, one rather more so than the other ; he (Dr. E.) wished to know if she saw double ; she appeared to see everybody; but her vision was much disturbed, for she never winked when the fingers were pushed suddenly towards the eyes, and when one finger was held up she said there were two ; when two, that there were four ; then she often said that people's " eyes were turning round," &c. This double vision was a common occurrence when one eye converged more than another, and arose from the adductor muscle on one side being drawn aside. When a watch was held to her, she could not tell the minute hand from the other, and it all appeared confused to her, though she seemed to the looker-on to have perfect vision. This symptom has been remarked in other similar cases, as well as the effect also of light on the iris, and pushing the fingers against the eyes, which produced no winking.

All religions, or rather all people, worship the same God, regardless of the name they use. Why then would one attempt to exterminate the other simply because they believe in different religions, or because one has not yet reached the same degree of enlightenment as that of the aggressor? People may be excused for not believing in the word of the one who was animated by the Spirit of God and sent by God, especially since they have not seen him and have not witnessed the divine acts. In any event, how can you honestly hope that they would heed his message of peace, when you try to force it upon them with violence? It is true that they need to be enlightened and it is your duty to try to teach them Christ’s doctrine. However, this must be done calmly and peacefully, not through violence.

However, do not believe that destiny is absolute. It is often a consequence for individuals who choose the wrong path, one that does not correspond to their intelligence and abilities. If people try to cross a river without knowing how to swim, they stand a very good chance of drowning, and we can say the same about most events in your life. If people only attempted things that are in harmony with their abilities, they would usually succeed. The cause of their failure is their conceit and ambition, which veer them off their proper path, and make them mistake a desire to satisfy passions for vocation. They fail by their own fault, but instead of blaming themselves, they prefer to blame their ‘star’. For example, an individual who could have been a good craftsperson and honorably earn a living in that capacity prefers to write bad poetry, and ultimately dies of starvation. There would be a place for everyone, if everyone assumed their proper place.”

>When we are in the spirit world, our entire past is revealed and the good or bad that we did is known. Those who have done evil who try to avoid their victims do so in vain. They cannot escape their presence, and it is an atonement and a source of remorse until they atone for the wrongs they have done. Conversely, kindness and goodwill surrounds the spirit of an upright person. Even on Earth, there is no greater torment for a bad person than the presence of his or her victims, whom they try to avoid at all costs. What happens when the illusions of passions dissipate and they understand the wrongs they have done? When they see their secret actions brought to light and their hypocrisy unmasked? When they realize that they cannot hide from those they have wronged? While the soul of the wicked is prey to shame, regret and remorse, the soul of the virtuous enjoys perfect peace. 978.

>“Merit is not the word. Although it is better than doing nothing, people who give only after they die are often motivated by selfishness rather than by generosity. They want the honor of doing good without any cost to them. People who impose deprivation upon themselves during their life, reap a double reward, the merit of their sacrifice and the pleasure of witnessing the happiness they have caused. Selfishness is likely to taunt, ‘Whatever you give away will lessen the enjoyment of what you keep for yourself.’ The voice of selfishness is louder than that of charity, and too often it leads a person to keep what they have under the pretext of necessity. You should pity a person who does not know the joy of giving because they deprive themselves of one of the purest and sweetest pleasures in life. In subjecting a person to the trial of wealth, which can be very dangerous for their future, God places the happiness that generosity may secure for them within their reach, even in the present life.” (See no. 814.)

When you escape this danger, and while still feeling the emotion stimulated by the danger you encountered, you think according to the degree in which you are influenced by good spirits to mend your ways. If a bad spirit dominates (In using the word bad I am referring to the evil that is still within that spirit), you think that you will escape other dangers in the same manner, and once again you give free rein to your passions. Through the dangers that you encounter, God reminds you of your weakness and the fragility of your existence. If you examine the cause and nature of the peril you have escaped, you will see that in many cases its consequences would have been the atonement of some fault you have committed, or some duty you have neglected.

>Our critics counter by inquiring why spirits, who should know everything, are unable to answer simple questions, as dictated by the adage, “He who can do the most can do the least,” and conclude, from this assumed inability, that the phenomena cannot be caused by spirits. If an ignorant or foolish person were to stand before an academic council and ask why it is light out in the middle of the day, would a reply be given? Would it be reasonable to conclude, from the derision or silence with which such a question might be received, that its members were merely imbeciles? It is precisely because they are at a higher level than us that spirits decline to answer idle and foolish questions.

Ingratitude comes from selfishness and people who are selfish, eventually, meet hearts as callous as their own. Think of all those who have done more good than you, who are more worthy than you are, and whose kindnesses were paid with ingratitude. Remember that, in his life, Jesus was ridiculed, despised and treated as both a criminal and a fraud; you should not be shocked if you are treated in the same way. The knowledge that you have done good should be your reward in your present life, and do not worry about what people who have benefited from it say. Ingratitude tests your persistence in doing good. It counts in your favor, in the future, and those who have ignored your kindness will be punished. The greater their ingratitude, the more severe the atonement.”

The purpose of a trial is not to enlighten God regarding the merit of humankind. God knows exactly what they are worth, but to make human beings fully accountable for their behavior since they have free will. People are free to choose between good and bad, and trials serve to tempt them or prove their resistance, leaving them all the merit for resisting it.

Wicked spirits always come to assist you in carrying out the malevolence you desire to commit. They only help you do wrong when you give in to vile desires.

>A spirit knows that, in choosing such a road, it will experience a specifc struggle. It knows the nature of the problems that it will encounter, but does not know how they will present themselves. The details of events are the product of circumstances and the force of things; the spirit anticipates only the leading events of a new life and the determining effects on its destiny. If you turn down a road or path full of potholes, you know that you must proceed very carefully because you run a risk of falling. You do not know exactly where you may fall, and if you are prudent, you might not fall at all. If a tile falls on your head while you are walking down the street, you should not think that ‘it was meant to be,’ as is commonly said.”
## 11: Kardec (1857) 1118 [3e-04]

>“Fatalism only exists based on the choice each spirit makes to undergo a trial. By choosing that trial, you create a sort of destiny for yourself. It is the natural consequence of the situation in which you have chosen to place yourself. This is only with respect to physical trials, because in moral trials and temptations, a spirit always maintains a freedom of choice between good and iniquity and is always able to yield or resist. Good spirits may come to your aid when they see you falter, but cannot influence you to the extent of controlling your will. On the other hand, bad or inferior spirits may trouble or alarm you by exaggerating your physical danger. However, the will of your incarnate spirit maintains its full freedom of choice.”
## 12: Kardec (1857) 816 [3e-04]

>“No, there is no such thing as a pact. It is merely sympathy between a vile nature and despicable spirits. For example, imagine you want to irritate your neighbor, but you do not know how. You call out for the assistance of lower order spirits. These spirits, like yourself, want nothing more than to do wrong and in return for the help they give you, they expect you to help them. This does not mean that your neighbor will not be able to fight such a conspiracy with an opposing scheme and the force of his or her own will. If you desire to do evil you call wicked spirits to your assistance by that desire alone, and you are in turn obliged to serve them as they have served you, because they need your help in the evil they seek to do. What you call a pact consists simply in this mutual assistance in doing wrong.”
## 13: Kardec (1857) 363 [3e-04]

>This confusion is completely dependent on specifc features, and the type of death. In cases of violent death, suicide, torture, accident, stroke, injuries, and so on, the spirit is shocked and does not believe that it is dead. It stubbornly maintains the contrary and views the body that it has left as something separate from itself. It recognizes its body and cannot understand how it could be separated from it. It remains among those it has loved, speaks to them, and does not understand why they do not hear it. This illusion lasts until the perispirit has fully separated from the physical body. It is only when this is accomplished that the spirit begins to understand that it no longer is part of the physical world.
## 14: Kardec (1857) 54 [3e-04]

>“Spirits are attracted through empathy for the moral nature of those who contact them. Superior spirits enjoy serious-minded sessions, driven by the love of goodness and the genuine desire to learn and improve. Their presence deters inferior spirits, who, on the contrary, are attracted to free access and may freely act on frivolous individuals or those guided by mere curiosity, and wherever immoral instincts are found. Instead of obtaining good advice or useful information from these spirits, nothing is to be expected from them but trivial diversions, lies, tricks, or hoaxes, as they often assume the names of the most respected and recognized individuals in order to more effortlessly lead people astray.”
## 15: Kardec (1857) 1202 [3e-04]

>“Since human beings are aware of the bad they do, they must also be aware of the good they do as well. It is only by this recognition of their conscience that they can know whether they have done good or bad. By weighing all their actions according to God’s law, especially the law of justice, love and charity, they can decide whether they are good or bad, and can approve or disapprove of those actions accordingly. Therefore, it is not wrong to recognize the fact that they have triumphed over evil and rejoice in having done so, provided that this does not turn into narcissism, because that would be as reprehensible as any of the faults over which they have triumphed.” (See no. 919.)
## 16: King (1987) 333 [3e-04]

>Therefore is it evident, — that many are the means to Knowledge, and many are the paths by which we may reach the Goal of the Initiate — wherefore — I would say to each of you; — absurd and ill-judged is it to rule that all shall crowd into one path, because that happens to be the one chosen by one member. There is too much tendency to wish all to follow the Ideal of one, — we are apt to forget that the Ideal of each will lead to the same Truth. We can help each other better, then, by helping each to rise according to his own ideas, rather than, as we often Unwisely do, in advising him to rise to what is best in ourselves only.
## 17: Kardec (1857) 909 [3e-04]

>“We have already told you that when spirits are created they are simple and ignorant (see no. 115). God leaves all human beings free to choose their own path; too bad for them if they choose the wrong one, their journey will be longer. If there were no mountains, humans could not grasp the concept of climbing uphill and descending. If there were no rocks, they could not understand the concept that hard bodies exist. Spirits must acquire experience, and to do this properly they must know both good and bad. This is why there is an union of spirit and body.” (See no. 119.)
## 18: Kardec (1857) 664 [3e-04]

>“This is what happens: The person falls asleep, and his or her spirit awakens. The spirit of that person is often very far from following the plan that it decided upon while in the body because human life is of little interest to a spirit when its free from matter. This only applies to those members of the human race who have already reached a certain degree of perfection. Others spend their spiritual life very differently. They give free rein to their passions, or remain inactive. It may so happen that a spirit visits someone that their incarnated self suggests to visit before falling asleep, but this is not because it was willed to do so while awake.”
## 19: Kardec (1857) 1114 [3e-04]

>“If the intelligence of human beings is altered by any cause whatsoever, then they are no longer the masters of their thoughts and are no longer free. Such anomaly is often an atonement for spirits who, in another life, have been vain or arrogant, or have made bad use of their faculties. They may be reborn in the body of a mentally impaired person, as a tyrant may be reborn in the body of a slave, and a callous wealthy man in that of a beggar. Such spirits suffer from this constraint, of which they are fully aware, and this is the action of matter.” (See no. 371 et seq.)
## 20: Kardec (1857) 1128 [3e-04]

>“Yes, but you saw those incidents when you chose your life as a spirit. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to assume that everything that happens to you was ‘written in the stars’ as people say. An event is often the consequence of something you have done by an act of your own volition. Had you not done that thing, the event would not have taken place. If you burn your finger, it is a trivial inconvenience resulting from your own carelessness and a consequence of matter, not destiny. Only great sorrows, serious events that are capable of influencing your moral state, are predestined by God because they will be useful to your purification and education.”
## 21: Kardec (1857) 1148 [3e-04]

>Fatalism, however, is not a meaningless word. It really exists with regard to the position held by all human beings on Earth and the roles they fill. Fatalism is a consequence of the type of existence their spirits chose as a trial, repentance, or mission. They are subjected to the digressions of the life they have chosen, in addition to all the intrinsic temptations, good or bad. This is where fatalism ends, because human will determines if they yield to those temptations or not. The details of events depend on the circumstances that human beings cause by their actions, and they may be influenced by the good or bad thoughts suggested by spirits. (See no. 459.)
## 22: Kardec (1857) 1138 [3e-04]

>“You yourself have chosen your trial. The more severe it is and the better you bear it, the higher you are elevated. Those who spend their physical lives selfishly enjoying wealth and happiness are cowardly spirits who remain stationary. The number of those who are unfortunate is much greater in your world than those who are fortunate, because spirits generally choose the trial that will be most useful to them. They too clearly see the futility of your splendor and pleasures. Besides, the most fortunate life is always more or less troubled, if only by the absence of sorrow.” (See no. 525 et seq.)
## 23: Kardec (1857) 1167 [3e-04]

>According to Jesus, charity is not restricted to giving alms, but covers all our relations with our fellow human beings whether inferior, equal or superior. It preaches indulgence on our part because we need the same ourselves, and it forbids us from humiliating the unfortunate, as is too often done. How many of us lavish respect and attention on the rich, yet think that being civil to the poor is not worth the time or effort? Yet, the more deplorable the situation of the poor, the more painstakingly we should refrain from adding humiliation to their misfortune. Those who are truly kind, try to elevate others to their level by reducing the distance between them.
## 24: Cahagnet (1855) 590 [3e-04]

>" The greatest difficulty is to know whether the communication which men have with angels and souls separated can be performed in the same manner (by meeting forthwith) ; for it can not be doubted that there is some society between us and them, since there is such between all intelligent natures, and since the communication we must have together is a point of true religion ; angels and blessed souls can, in truth, come to us, penetrate us, and unite themselves to our thoughts, but we can not go to them if they are in heaven. What, then, can become of our wishes and prayers with respect to them ? how should they, being so far off, know our wants and wishes ?"
## 25: Kardec (1857) 827 [3e-04]

>“God does not listen to an unfair curse, and whoever speaks it is guilty in God’s eyes. As we are subjected to two contrasting influences, good and bad, there may be a short-lived action. However, this action can never take place unless God wills it to happen as an additional trial for the subject of said curse. In any event, curses are usually set on the wicked, and blessings on the good. Neither a blessing nor a curse can escape Providence’s justice, which only strikes the cursed if they are wicked, and favors the blessed if they merit protection.”

SPIRIT OCCUPATIONS AND MISSIONS
## 26: Kardec (1857) 66 [4e-04]

>The errors of some, though unfortunate for the honor of their memory, do not invalidate our esteem in regard to other matters. Common sense is not dictated by an offcial diploma, and there are fools both inside and outside the walls of academic institutions. We ask our adversaries to simply glance over the supporters of Spiritism and determine whether they see only uneducated imbeciles, or whether, despite the immense number of respectable individuals who have accepted it, Spiritism can be regarded as an old wives’ tale. In fact, their character and scientifc knowledge should inspire people to think, “If these persons believe in this, there must be something to it.”
## 27: Kardec (1857) 738 [4e-04]

>The word possession, as popularly understood, presumes the existence and cohabitation of demons, that is, a category of beings of a wicked nature, with a person’s soul in his or her body. Since demons do not exist in the aforementioned sense, and since two spirits cannot simultaneously inhabit the same body, there is no such thing as possession according to the idea normally attached to that word.. You should understand the word possessed defined only as the absolute domination of a soul by an imperfect spirit to whom it has surrendered.475. Can a soul drive degraded spirits away and free itself from their control?
## 28: Kardec (1857) 545 [4e-04]

>“Both. Everything that it is interested in remembering appears to it as if it were present. Others life events appear more or less vaguely in its thoughts, or are forgotten entirely. The more dematerialized the spirit is, the less importance it attaches to material things. When we communicate with an errant spirit who has just left this world, it often forgets the names of people it liked or other details that may seem important to you. They are inconsequential to the spirit and it erases them from its memory. However, it remembers perfectly the main events of its life that have contributed to its improvement.”
## 29: King (1987) 28 [4e-04]

>Be moderate in all things human. Extreme ascetic habits, are to you here, a source of another danger, they may lead only to a contemplation of your own Heroism, in being abstinent. To be truly ascetic is indeed to submit to discipline and to curb unruly emotions, thoughts and actions. But, who is a slave to his animal soul, will practice vice even in a Forest; while he who restrains himself among the crowds of a city, and passes through a busy life — unpolluted, shows more resistance and suffers a severer discipline, and shall obtain a greater reward. Flying Roll No. II, Part II
## 30: Kardec (1857) 494 [4e-04]

>The pain that we endure in our present life is sometimes independent of our actions, but it is often the consequence of our own volition. If we trace the root of our suffering, we see that in most cases it is due to causes that we could have avoided. How many problems and illnesses can a person trace back to overindulgence, ambition and the impulses of numerous passions! If a person could live a completely sober life without ever overindulging and remaining simple and modest in tastes and desires, such an individual would escape a large majority of the pain and suffering of human life.
## 31: Kardec (1857) 1187 [4e-04]

>“They have the merit of disinterestedness, but not that of the good they might do. While disinterestedness is a virtue, thoughtless spending reveals a lack of judgment, to say the least. Fortune is no more given to some individuals to be thrown away than to others to be locked up in a safe. This is a deposit for which they will have to render an account. They will have to answer for all the good they might have done, but also that which they failed to do. As well as all the tears they could have dried with the money they wasted on those who did not truly need it.”
## 32: Kardec (1857) 1237 [4e-04]

>Assuming a position outside one’s intellectual scope is one of the most frequent causes of failure and disappointment. Lack of aptitude for the career one has set out to follow is a never-ending source of disappointment. Often pride prevents people, who fail in one career, to seek a humbler vocation. They are frequently tempted to commit suicide in order to escape what they view as humiliation. If a sound moral education elevates them above the stupid prejudices of pride, they are never at a loss to earn a living.
## 33: Cahagnet (1855) 110 [4e-04]

>I asked Adele what impression she experienced at the ajDproach of a spirit. She replied : *' T am fearful, timid, and bashful, while it is speaking to me ; I find myself but little worthy of approaching so near to beings so pure, so beautiful, so sylphlike, and with such benignant looks; T compare myself, in their presence, to a lifeless block, and am at times glad when they depart, that I may no longer behold so coarse a contrast; their visit leaves the mind in a sweet calm, the air seems more pure; in short, one is quite happy !"
## 34: King (1987) 187 [4e-04]

>We must all take courage and look our difficulties full in the face, neither magnifying them nor avoiding them; and we shall find in many cases that a little self-denial, a little exertion of Will, or even a little commonplace prudence will vanquish them completely. Nothing impossible will ever be asked of any of you, but what will be possible to each of you is in the Future, none can say exactly what. With knowledge will come strength, and then experience will follow and the power and the wish to use that Knowledge rightly.

>“God created all spirits simple and unaware, meaning lacking all knowledge. God has given them each a particular mission, to enlighten them and help them gradually reach perfection through the knowledge of the truth, and rise closer to Him. In that perfection they will find eternal bliss without any troubles. Spirits acquire knowledge by experiencing the trials inflicted by God. While some accept these trials with resignation and arrive at their destiny more quickly, others are defiant and remain far from the perfection and happiness promised to them through no fault other than their own.”

>“No, because if they do no wrongdoing, then they do not do good either. Moreover, not doing good, in itself, is wrong. God wants us to think of Him, but God does not want us to think only of Himself, since God has given the human being duties to fulfill on earth. Those who spend their entire lives in meditation and contemplation do nothing praiseworthy in God’s eyes because such a life is completely private and useless to humankind. God will ask them to account for the good they have failed to do.” (See no. 640.)
## 38: Kardec (1857) 936 [4e-04]

>“Prayer is always pleasing to God when it comes from the heart. Intention is everything in God’s eyes and a prayer from the heart is preferable to one read from a book, no matter how beautiful it may be, if you read more with the lips than with the thought. Prayer is pleasing to God when it is offered with faith, passion and sincerity. God will ignore the prayer of a vain, proud or selfish person, unless it is offered as an act of sincere repentance and humility.”
## 39: Levi (1860) 684 [4e-04]

>It is true that Vintras does not hold himself responsible for what he writes; this is how he speaks on the subject. “If my mind counted for anything in these condemned works, I should bow my head and fear would possess my soul. But the work is not my work, and I have had no concurrence therein, either by research or desire. Calm is within me; my couch knows no vigils; watches have not wearied my eyes; my sleep is pure, as when God first gave it; I can say to my God with a free heart: _Custodi animam meum et erue me: non erubescam, quoniam speravi in te_.”
## 40: Kardec (1857) 504 [4e-04]

>“Of course not, because there are many spirits who from the outset follow a road that spares them the necessity of undergoing many of those trials. However, when they travel down the wrong road they expose themselves to all the dangers of that road. A spirit, for instance, may ask for wealth and the request may be granted. In that case, it may become greedy or wasteful, selfsh or generous, make a noble use of its wealth, or waste it on meaningless sensual pursuits depending on its character. But this does not imply that it is compelled to experience all those tendencies.”
## 41: Kardec (1857) 1120 [4e-04]

>The true or false ideas that we adopt of the things around us cause us to succeed or fail in our undertakings depending on our character and social standing. It seems easier and less humiliating to our self-esteem to attribute our failures to fate or destiny than to our own mistakes. While spirits may sometimes influence our success, we can always free ourselves from this influence by resisting the ideas they suggest if they are misleading or bad.853. Some people escape one danger only to fall prey to another, as if it were impossible for them to escape death. Is this not fatalism?
## 42: King (1987) 330 [4e-04]

>Though far more difficult to live than the life in which we can dispose of our time, more or less, at will, this need not be a delay in our development; these daily duties may indeed be an increased strength to us. But in such a case, must we aim always at the Purest and the Best of that occupation, whatever it may be, and attempt to develop in i t those qualities that we may be weak or deficient in, such as courage, resolution, patience, concentration, etc., which can be learned in the performance of any work, however petty.
## 43: Kardec (1857) 508 [4e-04]

>“It chooses those which may help amend its faults, and at the same time help the spirit advance more quickly. With these goals in mind, some may impose a life of poverty and deprivation upon themselves to learn to bear them with courage. Others may wish to test their power to resist the temptations of fortune and power, which are much more dangerous because of the abuse they may entail, and the vile passions that they may develop. Others may want to strengthen their good resolutions by struggling against the infuence of vices.”
## 44: Kardec (1857) 933 [4e-04]

>“As in so many other things, the intention determines the worth of the act. When a person is simply showing respect for the beliefs of others, it is not wrong. This is better than the person who ridicules them because that would show a lack of charity. However, those who carry out such practices simply for selfish motives or ambition are despicable in the eyes of God and humanity. God gets no gratification or joy out of seeing those who pretend to humble themselves solely for the approval of their fellow human beings.”
## 45: Kardec (1857) 1087 [4e-04]

>“They are in no way responsible for the wrong that may have been done by others, and of which they may not even be aware. Often, fortune is granted to specific individuals for the sole purpose of giving them the opportunity of making amends for an injustice. If these individuals understand this, good for them! If these individuals do it in the name of the person who committed the injustice, the reparation will be counted to both of them, because it is often the latter who, now in the spiritual world, has stimulated the incarnate ones to work towards this reparation.”
## 46: Kardec (1857) 415 [4e-04]

>“No, the knowledge acquired in each life is not lost. When a spirit is free from the material body, it always remembers what it has learned. It may forget this knowledge partially or temporarily when it reincarnates. However, the dormant intuition that it maintains helps it advance. If this intuition did not exist, the spirit would always have to begin its education from scratch. In a new life, a spirit picks up from the point at which it had left at the end of its previous life.”
## 47: Kardec (1857) 289 [4e-04]

>130. If the opinion that acknowledges that some beings have been created perfect and superior to all others is wrong, why is this belief found in almost every population or religion?
“You need to understand that your world has not existed for all eternity. Long before it existed, masses of spirits had already attained the supreme degree. Therefore, the people on Earth naturally assume that those perfected spirits have always been at the same degree of elevation.”
## 48: Kardec (1857) 872 [4e-04]

>“It remains in a type of errant state, because it is not tied to a body, but it is not exactly an errant spirit. Errant spirits think and act of their own free will, while the souls of animals do not have the same ability. Self-awareness is the main attribute of the spirit. An animal’s soul is classifed after death by the spirits responsible for that task, and it is almost immediately utilized. It does not have the freedom to connect with other creatures.”
## 49: Kardec (1857) 1125 [4e-04]

>“Individuals often have a premonition of their end. On the other hand, such individuals may also have a sense that their time of death has not yet come. This intuition is due to the action of their protective spirits, who warn them to be ready to go or boost their courage when they particularly need it. It may also come to them from the intuition they have of the life they have chosen, or of the mission they have accepted that they know they must fulfill.” (See nos. 411–522.)
## 50: Kardec (1857) 564 [4e-04]

>“When a spirit has reached a certain degree of perfection, it is no longer controlled by human pride or pleasure and understands their futility. Still, there are many spirits who take great pleasure in the honors paid to their memory. There are some who are disturbed at discovering that they have been forgotten when they frst cross over into the other life. They still have not shed some of the false ideas they held during their physical life.”
## 51: Kardec (1857) 581 [4e-04]

>“If you are asking whether it complains of the life it has to suffer, and whether it wishes it were otherwise like the way many human beings do, then yes. If you ask whether it regrets its choice, then no. Remember that the spirit does not recall the choice it made. Once incarnated, a spirit cannot regret a choice that it is not conscious of having made. It may find the burden it assumed too heavy and turn to suicide if it is too much for it to bear.”
## 52: Kardec (1857) 988 [4e-04]

>“At the selfishness of humans, who too often prevents them to do what they need. Next, and most often, the individuals themselves are to blame. Christ said, ‘Seek, and you shall find but these words do not imply that all you have to do is look down on the ground to find anything that you may want. You must search for what you want passionately and with perseverance, without being discouraged by obstacles that are often only a means of testing your determination, patience, and resolve.” (See no. 534.)
## 53: Kardec (1857) 1305 [4e-04]

>When errant, a spirit sees all its past lives at a glance and foresees the future promised to it. It understands what it still needs to do to reach that future. It is like a traveler who having reached the top of a hill sees both the road it traveled, and what it still has to travel to reach the end of the journey. 976. Is seeing suffering spirits a cause of distress for the good ones? If so, what becomes of the happiness of the latter, as that happiness has been impaired?
## 54: Kardec (1857) 1314 [4e-04]

>“The union of spirits who sympathize with the love of goodness is one of their greatest joys, because they have no fear of seeing that union disturbed by selfishness. In the spiritual world, they form families inspired by the same sentiment, as they group into categories and experience joy in being together. This union constitutes the happiness of those worlds. The pure and sincere affection that elevated spirits feel, and of which they are the object, is a source of happiness because there are neither false friends nor hypocrites among them.”
## 55: Kardec (1857) 1380 [4e-04]

>“All of you, people of faith and goodwill must enthusiastically and courageously devote yourselves to the noble work of regeneration. You will in turn reap a hundredfold for every seed you sow. Woe to those who close their eyes against the light, because they will sentence themselves to centuries of darkness and sorrow! Woe to those who focus their happiness on the things of this world, because they will suffer hardships that far exceeds their present joys! And above all, woe to the selfish, because they will find no one to help them bear the burden of their misery.”
CONCLUSION
## 56: Kardec (1857) 919 [4e-04]

>“There is no one who cannot do some good. Only the selfish find no opportunity of doing so. The mere fact of being in contact with other human beings provides the opportunity of doing good every day of your lives, for those who are not consumed by self-interest. Doing good is not restricted to giving to charity, but also includes being useful whenever your assistance may be needed, to the full extent of your power.”
## 57: Kardec (1857) 1318 [4e-04]

>Belief in Spiritism helps our self-improvement by clearing up our ideas about our future. It hastens the progress and advancement of individuals and the masses because it enables people to ascertain what the future will be, and is both a beacon and source of support. Spiritism teaches us to bear our trials with patience and resignation, turns us away from actions that could delay our future happiness, and contributes to our reaching that happiness. However, it does not imply that we may not reach that same happiness without it.
## 58: Kardec (1857) 462 [5e-04]

>“It depends on their merit. They suffer from the passions they have retained, and are more or less happy depending on the strength of their connection to material life. When a spirit is in an errant state, it has perceptions of what it needs in order to be happy. When this happens, it is compelled to seek what it lacks. However, a spirit is not always permitted to reincarnate when it desires to do so, and in that case it becomes a punishment.”
## 59: Kardec (1857) 731 [5e-04]

>“By doing only what is right and putting all your faith in God, you repel lower spirits and prevent them from controlling you. Do not listen to spirits who inspire you with despicable thoughts, cause confict, and stimulate malicious passions. Particularly distrust those who fatter your pride because this is how a spirit attacks you at your weakest point. This is why Jesus makes you recite in the Lord’s Prayer, ‘Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.’”
## 60: Kardec (1857) 1194 [5e-04]

>“Of course there is. This knowledge enables you to benefit humankind. Also, if your spirit has already progressed in intelligence, it will rise faster in the spirit life and learn in an hour what it would take years to learn on Earth. No knowledge is useless since it all contributes to your advancement in one form or another. A perfect spirit must know everything and progress must be made in every direction. All acquired ideas help forward development.”
## 61: Kardec (1857) 1272 [5e-04]

>People who take their own lives to escape the shame of a bad action prove that they attach more value to the opinion of other people than to that of God. They return to the spirit world burdened by their wrongdoings. As a result, they deprive themselves of the atonement planned for the current life. God is not as inexorable as human beings are. God pardons those who sincerely repent and takes into account our efforts to remedy our wrongs, but suicide resolves nothing.
## 62: Kardec (1857) 1333 [5e-04]

>“Yes, always and they then suffer even more because they feel all the wrong they have done, or which they have voluntarily caused. Nevertheless, repentance is not always immediate. There are spirits who stubbornly persist in doing wrong, despite their suffering. Eventually however, they see that they have taken the wrong path and repentance ensues. The efforts of higher spirits are directed to enlightenment, and you may usefully direct your own efforts toward the same goal.”
## 63: Kardec (1857) 826 [5e-04]

>“Magnetic power may act to that extent when it is supported by a purity of intent and the fervent desire to do good. In such a case, good spirits render their services. You must be cautious of exaggerated stories recounted by individuals who, overly gullible or enthusiastic, can discover something spectacular in even the most ordinary and natural occurrences. Likewise, be cautious of individuals who exploit gullibility for their own benefit.”
## 64: Kardec (1857) 942 [5e-04]

>Through our thought and will, we possess a power of action that extends far beyond the limits of our physical world. To pray for others is an act of volition. If our will is passionate and sincere, it calls good spirits to the aid of the party prayed for, and helps that person by suggesting good thoughts and providing the strength of body and soul that he or she needs. Once again, a prayer from the heart is everything, while that of just the lips is worthless.

>The possibility of communicating with spirits is extremely comforting, since it gives us the means of conversing with our relatives and friends who have left this life before us. By our contact, we draw them nearer to us, and they come to hear us and reply to us. There is no longer any separation between them and us. They aid us with their guidance, and assure us of how pleased they are that we remember them. We are happy to learn that they are happy, discover the details of their new existence from them, and obtain the certainty of reuniting with them one day.

>These limitations are easy — therefore dear to the human hearts of human teachers — very easy it is to say ‘My way is the only way — walk ye in it’. Very hard it is to see the way that lies before another and to aid him to walk in the path that the Master has traced before him — much easier to force him if it may be — to walk in thy path. Much easier — but not the Master’s method. ‘Forbid him not, because he walketh not with you’.

>Those who hold an inferior position want to change it as soon as possible. In addition, those who know that the trials and tribulations of the present life are the consequences of their own imperfections seek any means possible to insure a new existence that is less painful. This attitude will much more effectively keep them away from a bad path than the threat of eternal fre, which they do not believe in anyway.

>“When a thought is suggested, it is like a voice speaking to you. Your own thoughts usually occur to you first. This distinction is not of much practical importance to you, and it is often better not to be able to make it. Your action then has greater freedom. If you choose the right road, you do so more spontaneously, while if you take the wrong one, your responsibility will be greater.”

>If it were useful for us to be able to distinguish between our own thoughts and the ones suggested clearly, God would have given us the means of doing so, just as God has given us the means of distinguishing between day and night.

>“No, it is not because they can’t but because they choose not to. Their wards will become wiser and better through the trials they have chosen for themselves. Protective spirits assist their wards through the wise guidance they provide however, unfortunately, sometimes they are ignored. The weakness, carelessness, or pride of humans is what gives strength to bad spirits. Their power over you comes solely from your lack of willpower to provide enough resistance to their action.”

>“Of course not. But those who do good impulsively, simply for the sake of pleasing God and providing relief to their suffering neighbors, have already reached a higher degree of advancement and are closer to reaching ultimate happiness than their brothers and sisters who, being more selfish, do good in hopes of receiving a reward, instead of being compelled by the goodness of their own hearts.” (See no. 894.)

How is he to get emancipation, or pardon, or the blotting out of the evil or wickedness he has already done?"

>For my part, I have never been able to persuade myself that our spirits live only so long as they are within our bodies ; and that they die when they quit them, or that they remain, stripped of intelligence and wisdom, when disengaged from a body that has by itself neither sense nor reason ; I believe, on the contrary, that when the spirit, disengaged from matter, finds itself, in all the purity and simplicity of its nature, it is then that it possesses most light and wisdom."

>b) Should a distinction be made between the good we do for our neighbors and the effort we put forward to correct our own faults?

>It is regrettable that Synesius should write in this strain, as nothing can be more impolitic than to let a reservation appear when one is entrusted with public teaching.

>“An incarnated spirit is under the complete infuence of matter. Individuals who are able to overcome this infuence, through the elevation and purifcation of their soul, are one step closer to the good spirits, among whom they will one day be placed. Those who allow themselves to be controlled by bad passions and find satisfaction in physical appetites lower themselves to the level of impure spirits by allowing their animal natures to reign.”
## 78: Kardec (1857) 506 [5e-04]

>“God supplies what the spirit lacks due to inexperience by tracing out the road that it must follow, as you do for an infant in its cradle. God allows it to become the master of its choice little by little as its free will develops, and it is then that it often loses its way and takes the wrong road if it ignores the guidance of the good spirits, who try their best to guide it. This is what is called the downfall of humanity.”

>Through Spiritism, human beings enter a new phase, that of moral progress which is the inevitable consequence of this belief. The rapid spread of Spiritist ideas should be no surprise, due to the profound satisfaction they give to those who accept them as more than just a futile pastime.

No Theosophist has ever yet succeeded in bringing forward a single valid proof to shake my scepticism.

>“‘Attached’ is not accurate. It is very true that bad spirits try to draw you from the path of righteousness when they find an opportunity to do so. However, when one of them attaches to an individual it does so simply because it hopes the person is going to listen to them. In such a case, there is a struggle between a good and a bad spirit, and whoever successfully infuences that individual prevails.”

>“Just like human beings, some spirits are lazy and avoid a life of labor. God leaves them to their devices because they eventually learn the consequences of their uselessness, and then eagerly ask to be allowed to make up for lost time.

>Circumstances give good and evil a relative seriousness. Humans often commit faults that are reprehensible as a consequence of the social positions in which they are placed.

When a person violates one of those laws, God does not say, ‘You have been gluttonous, I will punish you for it.’ However, God has set a limit: diseases, and even death, are the consequences of overstepping that limit. Any time you are disciplined, it is a result of violating a law. Everything happens that way.”

Only higher spirits can take in everything at a single glance.”

>“Sometimes it is imposed, in support of the different trials to be suffered by a spirit, especially when the latter is still too inferior to be able to make the choice for itself. As a form of atonement, a spirit may be forced to enter the body of a child that, due to its birth and the circumstances it will encounter in the world, it will serve for the spirit as a way of atonement.”

>Evidence may be received in favor of what has been said, from all well-ascertained truths in science and Nature. Indeed, the conviction that Nature presses upon the mind is irresistible. And evidence of truth has its foundation only in the unchangeable manifestations of Nature; for all truths, being eternal, are established in that which is also eternal, -and are consequently therein manifested. The various scientific and philosophical facts and truths, and all theories that are immovably established, will converge in their respective conclusions and form a united evidence of the truth of the things herein presented. Still, as prior causes are both internal and invisible, although they produce effects visible, these are not always correctly manifested to the senses. For effects are exceedingly changed in their appearance by incidental and surrounding causes. At times, however, effects are truly visible; but only when conditions and circumstances are extremely favorable. Still, effects constantly occur; and these again are the cause of others; so that all things are developed by a concatenation of established causes, each of which follows the specific guidance of an immutable Law. Therefore the innumerable causes that produce corresponding effects, are all referable to some established Principle that is demonstratively known by its results to be unchangeable.
## 2: Davis (1847) 963 [2e-04]

>And while the last attribute unfolded corresponds to all others, its grandeur rises above the highest conceptions of the minds of the world. And notwithstanding the arduous efforts that have been made to conceal this unfolding principle, it is gradually becoming more and more revealed as the interior qualities of mankind are capable of receiving it. This principle comprehends all below its degree of refinement, and contains qualities that will unfold eternally beyond. It is the medium of association between all spiritually-expanded minds. It encompasses and pervades all Nature — the whole world — the Universe. It is the essential germ of more perfect beauties, the highest attribute of the present sphere. It is that which is to be admired and adored above every other thing. It should illuminate the interior constitution of every being, and should give character to every thought; and while it gradually becomes more and more unfolded, it will beget in the mind an affection for an interior knowledge of present and ultimate things. And this is therefore the highest and most perfect principle unfolded from the original Germ consisting of Power; and such is the attribute of immortal TRUTH. And while this is the highest of the present attributes, it is a Germ that will ascend, as all other things progress, to more perfect manifestations in higher spheres.
## 3: Davis (1847) 2008 [2e-04]

>Here, then, is the sensuous evidence that the human form is a form determined by a corresponding creative essence, which is man's organized and immortal soul. Not only in viewing the whole Human World as one Form, is Intelligence discovered as an interior quality and essence, but in every individual structure are all the required qualities to demonstrate an absolute individualization of the interior, creative essence. The whole Human Form or World, is of itself the perfect creation of Nature. This cannot be said of the subordinate kingdoms. Moreover, a single human form is a perfect organization, representative, and reflection, of all the lower compounds in Nature. And thus man is the perfect flower, being progressively developed from all the lower parts of the same great Tree of ceaseless causation. Herein, then, lies the external evidence that man possesses an actuating and organized essence which no other form, possesses. And this will continue to retain its individuality, because it is the perfect form and perfect soul of all the lower degrees of Motion, Life, and Sensation, these being only the elements of the germ which, when perfected, flow into and form one perfect and indestructible Whole, which is the soul or spiritual essence of man.
## 4: Davis (1847) 262 [2e-04]

>δ 32. Each form, therefore, is constantly passing through an endless succession of spheres, in order to associate and correspond with the particles and essences that compose its original nature. And when the mechanic observes all these appearances, which are constantly developing themselves with accompanying principles of life and activity, he has the consolation of knowing that these all operate upon eternal mechanical law. And as developments in Nature become visible, he observes that all principles which are gradually evolved from the internal, are manifest in proportion to the perfection of the substance, form, and instrument, through which each motion and law is made visible. His experience corresponds with truths established in other sciences. —　And the whole confirms the propositions that have been established: That there is a constant and universal motion existing in matter, as an essential property of its nature; that it is continually (and must of necessity be) progressive; and that it also reproduces forms by virtue of the inherent properties of its nature, and that each assumes a degree and species and consequent peculiar association: that these are the production of Matter, and Life and Sensation the production of Motion; that the continuation and perfection of the two principles conjoined, compose Man as an Ultimate; and that man is composed of particles and essences of all things else existing.
## 5: Davis (1847) 189 [2e-04]

>For an understanding of the reasonings which may properly be based upon these classifications, according to the science of correspondences, familiar and physiological illustrations may be presented. These will answer as a chart for universal investigation; for effects are charts by which internal causes may be arrived at. For forms and effects are representatives in a higher degree, of what is existing in a lower or first degree; and the substance of ultimates is a development and —　progression of all beneath its sphere of existence, and is a compound of all substances, refined and rarified to a sphere of ultimate perfection. Consequently it involves all of the lower orders of spheres and existences. Hence it acts on, and subsists upon, substances and particles which compose the original elements of its nature. All beneath an ultimate, or an effect, thus supplies the effect and ultimate; and hence ultimates or effects correspond to, and represent all things in an inferior degree and sphere of perfection. Thus, the human body is a composition of all else:　 —　but to familiarize it with the understanding as corresponding with universals in Nature, an examination of its laws and functions generally, and a classification of them in series and degrees, will be necessary: and this will manifest the doctrines which it is necessary to enforce.
## 6: Davis (1847) 231 [2e-04]

>Every palaetiological science, therefore, adds proof of the great subject under contemplation. If Nature in a particular sense manifests unchangeable productions, having so many and various forms, complications, and correspondences, does not this amount to an absolute demonstration of her inherent and eternal operations in a general process of development? And as the germ of the herb produces body as an effect, and seed as an ultimate; so the Great Essence and Spiritual Fountain of all existence, produces Nature as an Effect, and Spirit as an Ultimate. Is there not internal and external evidence of this, which transcends the mere force of words to express thought? Are there not inward convictions dwelling in the mind, corresponding to its desires for a future and eternal state? Does not the internal constitute the substance of the external? Does not Nature, as an external Effect, point deeply and directly to the Internal, or Fountain of its original production? Is it not a chart whose various lines lead directly, and with almost mathematical certainty, to a future and higher state? Do not the inseparable truths which each science unfolds, constitute paths which terminate at one common Focus?
## 7: Davis (1847) 1440 [2e-04]

>Truth is an element of the Divine Mind, and is developed by the wisdom, uniformity, and harmony, which characterize and render perfect all that is created. It is therefore of divine and celestial origin, and is made manifest to the mind of man by the manifold expression of Nature and the Universe. Being an internal and controlling element, it pervades alike every department of the Univercoelum. It is therefore a necessary and unchangeable Principle, and hence also is ETERNAL. And while all created forms dwell in unity and harmony as arranged in their respective spheres of existence; while all rudimental productions are continually breathed forth and perpetuated by Nature and her laws; and while all the celestial spheres and systems of life, beauty, and perfection, continue to manifest and develop the same order and harmony, Truth will continue to proclaim her divine and eternal omnipotence. When all things that are created are restored to unity and stand in their proper and reciprocal relations, then may man perceive the full manifestation of that Truth which emanates from the celestial Vortex of Love and Wisdom.
## 8: Davis (1847) 2031 [2e-04]

>δ 182. We have now ascended in these psychological researches to a consideration of the specific attributes of the soul of man, their relations to each other, and their modes of manifestation from the inner to the outer world. For the question is now fully and irrefutably answered, What is man spiritually? Likewise it is proved, that the soul of man is a decided and established organization, preserving its identity by virtue of the peculiar character of its own constitution, and by the absence of all affinities which could absorb it in anything else. It has been made clear that every soul is differently constructed, this being manifest from the varieties and peculiarities of the human species. Every soul is thus individually organized, and cannot by any possible means become blended or inter-associated with others in such a way as that the soul's individual existence would be annihilated or immersed in the great ocean of moving and intangible substances. The law of association determines the perpetuity of every soul's identity, in both the material and spiritual world: for being in constitution dissimilar to each other and to all things, they cannot become annihilated or disorganized.
## 9: Davis (1847) 1972 [2e-04]

>It is, however, proper to introduce a few more illustrations. The first of these is to be found in the Key, and is established in the subsequent scientific considerations: and that is, "The interior is the real reality, and the productive cause of all external effects." And here this proposition is demonstrated even beyond the possibility of a doubt or refutation. For now we discover that the interior and real cause of the mineral, vegetable, and animal creations, is found only in the rudimental forms or first particles in each specific degree of formation and development. Hence it is impossible to discover the causes of visible effects in as visible a manner as the effects themselves are manifested. But in order to understand the nature and cause of effects, the substance constituting the effect must be analyzed, and its actuating principle discovered. In no other way can there be any absolute knowledge obtained concerning the nature and cause of any of the effects made manifest to the natural senses in the outer world.
## 10: Davis (1847) 139 [2e-04]

>All things in forms and corporeal investiture, which exist upon the face of the earth as displaying life, are correspondents of their inner life or principle — which not only actuates them to thriftiness, but is working, by an undeviating law, the refinement of all subordinate substances: and these visible, corporeal manifestations also stand in analogy with the ultimation of their inner and living principle, which by influx produces rudimental sensation in the organic system, and becomes a part of animal existence. So, tracing the refinement of matter from vegetable to animal existence (the life or soul of plants being perfected to become animal sensation), the refinement and perfection of these two, to become the substance of mind — and the progression of its nature to its second sphere and investiture — you arrive naturally and reasonably at an idea of the future properties, the positively individualized condition and existence of the mind in its first ultimate state of progression.* Admitting this much, you arrive at the condition of existence in which my mind is placed.
## 11: Davis (1847) 301 [2e-04]

>The mind must of necessity have some foundation whereupon it may rest, as it must investigate from a point established. The indications of Nature are of such a character as of themselves to convey a conception of the First Cause of all subordinate existences. Reasoning from the established axiom that there must be a Beginning, or a First Cause, to produce corresponding ones, it follows that either matter has existed from all eternity, or else the essence of an intelligent First Cause. One or the other of these conclusions must of necessity be drawn from the indications which all external substances and forms present. The idea is indisputable that something must have originally existed to produce that which does now exist; that Matter and Motion must have existed independently, or that the Great Cause must have been the Productor of that which does exist. The mind, therefore, is led back from effect to cause, until it conceives of the First Cause, or rather is compelled to admit the existence of such.
## 12: Davis (1847) 2016 [2e-04]

>δ 180. Form, then, is the only external mode by which all essences exist, and is the state which they assume in reference to all material things. The most delicate plant puts forth its tendrils, fibers, and finely-interwoven substances, only by virtue of the essence which develops itself fｒom the inner to the outer world in that form. And the rose, with all its beauty, delicacy, and fragrance, is a perfect representative of the interior essence that developed it. All such forms, however complicated and varied in appearance they may be, manifest only the essential qualities of their own creative soul. The outer, in every instance, is a perfect type, image, and correspondent, of the inner, from which it proceeded. The most delicate animal form is also a representation of its interior, living essence and actuating principle: and the most gigantic animal form is only a higher degree of development and a higher representative of corresponding qualities which are its soul and creator.
## 13: Davis (1847) 296 [2e-04]

>Matter and spirit have heretofore been supposed to constitute two distinct and independent substances, the latter not having any material origin. And minds not being able to comprehend this classification have been driven to extreme and illegitimate conclusions. And this would naturally tend, more than any other classification, to produce a disbelief in the united action of Nature. Instead of making material and spiritual existence totally disconnected, the object and intention of the foregoing has been to prove by acknowledged laws and principles of matter, the production of Intelligence, the perfection of which is Spirit; and to unite the whole operations and mutations of Nature's inherent properties of Motion, Life, and Sensation, from the Great Positive Mind through all intermediate things, to Man; to show that in Man this eternal principle of Spiritual Nature becomes individualized, —and that the First operated through Nature as a Second, to produce Spirit as a Third and grand result.
## 14: Davis (1847) 1180 [2e-04]

>When we conceive of an organization, we are at once impressed with the existence of parts and qualities necessary to constitute such properly. The whole is composed of parts, and the parts are necessary to the whole; yet these do not of themselves constitute a perfect organization. For an arch may be composed of an indefinite number of stones, without which the arch could not exist; but suppose the arch to be disorganized, this would not alter the fact that the stones are the parts, and remain in substance unchanged. In order, therefore, to form a perfect organization, it is not only necessary to have every part adapted to the whole, and each part to perform a use and fulfill a purpose, indicating a final cause, but it is necessary that these parts should have life and motion, and enter into mutual relations with each other, and thus form a whole or combined unity, in which a use must be manifest. And the use accomplished is the end of the organization.
## 15: Davis (1847) 980 [2e-04]

>Let the mind, then, infer the interior essence and quality by the external and visible form; but let it not judge entirely by the sheath or external of that which is in the interior, undeveloped. But it should rest upon the inward conviction received both in reference to the external and internal of anything, and thus the judgment would be proper and righteous. And as it is absolutely demonstrated that the cause of all effects exists anterior to them, it now devolves upon the properly-conditioned mind to judge of the interior by the external form. For it is evident that if essence did not exist, form could not: and if form exists, essence must of necessity be the cause of its existence. Essence therefore produces form by an association of its own qualities; and thus all conspicuous forms become unfolded. Thus it is the germ, which, when subjected to suitable conditions, becomes impregnated by its own, latent qualities, and unfolds all the forms and manifestations in the external world.
## 16: Davis (1847) 2018 [2e-04]

>And it is necessary that it should be well understood and borne in mind that form is not the creator of life, or of its attributes, but that the form, in every department of Nature, is the exterior mode of every living soul's existence. But in neither of the lower kingdoms have the forms an organized principle of interior life individually, but they have collectively, as constituting one perfect plane of form and creation. The human form has an organized principle individually, because every human organization is a congregation of all subordinate forms and substances in matter, and is likewise an indestructible representation of all. Thus the human body is a Universe, subsisting and existing upon all lower forms of organic life, and is of itself a whole creation, in and by which the labors of Nature, and the ultimate design of the Great Eternal Cause, are typified and absolutely fulfilled. And The human form is of all this a clear and living demonstration.
## 17: Davis (1847) 1978 [2e-04]

>Further: the various kingdoms and forms in this rudimental sphere, are all organs for the purpose of transferring, advancing, perfecting, and sublimating all particles in the lower forms of matter, so that they may all conjoin in harmony, and produce Man. Still further: the subordinate kingdoms are forms indispensable for the purpose of communicating a proper energy and quality to each particle of matter, in order to render it suitable to associate and assimilate with the human form. All particles must be modified, recomposed, and brought to a proper degree of perfection, or else the human form could not receive nourishment from, and be sustained by, the lower forms in Nature. This, again, is proof that man is a perfection of matter in all its forms and degrees of sublimation, and that he is the great Flower of the living Germ of this rudimental sphere, and is a Center to and from which flow spontaneously favors, from and to all the lower forms.
## 18: Davis (1847) 128 [2e-04]

>A natural tendency of the mind is to feel a conviction of its own continuance and progression. This amounts to a belief, but not to an absolute knowledge. For no collection of particles or substances of any kind, possesses the power of self-analyzation. Hence all above the power of the mind may be received as a desirable conviction, yet not a palpable reality. To me this reality is made perfect. My perceptions and general impressions are from the ultimate or perfection of all material substances. The scope of these perceptions and impressions, comprehends the substance of the second Sphere in a particular sense, even as it comprehends all in a general sense. And as the result of present things is the substance of the second Sphere, I in this Sphere have the perception of the things pre-impressed upon the mind to investigate. Things appear real to me which are beyond the reach of the natural organization, which knows of nothing except what exists in matter and form.
## 19: Davis (1847) 549 [2e-04]

>Human conceptions of order are founded upon the supposed reality of apparent confusion; and when apparent confusion and irregularities are observed, the mind instantly conceives of their opposite order. Hence if confusion were not apparent, the word order would be without meaning. But where order universally exists, and confusion is temporarily and minutely apparent to the mind, there the general conception of order, would be evidently correct; as it would be derived from contrasting the order of a general, with the disorder of an incidental character. Therefore if order is apparently universal, this at once establishes the doctrine of uniformity; and all particular and apparent confusion must be referred to incidental and local causes. But the great Whole being correctly comprehended, presents a system of undisturbed order and harmony!
## 20: Davis (1847) 2001 [2e-04]

>Keeping in mind, then, the uniform developments from the inner to the outer world, a knowledge is received concerning the corresponding development of the animal world. For as by understanding one particle of matter, with all its properties, tendencies, and capabilities, a corresponding knowledge is obtained concerning the structure of the whole Universe — so by understanding the mode of the existence of Life, an understanding is at once established concerning the higher degrees and similar modes of existence, as determined by their Soul or essence. And as by knowing the measurement of one inch, a rule is obtained by which may be measured the length and breadth of all material existence — so it is equally plain that if the existence of Life and Sensation is understood, the same laws and principles which govern these will introduce the mind into higher degrees and planes of corresponding exterior development.
## 21: Davis (1847) 2107 [2e-04]

>Every mind must conceive of the existence of a Cause as the parent of any effects visible to the senses. And the cause must be admitted as corresponding to the effect, or else the effect cannot be attributed to any producing cause. Hence it follows that all external and visible things are effects, prompted, created, and unfolded to the outer world, by a corresponding interior cause; and that the cause must be the real reality, or else such tangible effects could not have been produced. So all material things created by man are the forms of his thoughts; and these are the offspring of the soul. The form of man is a likeness, a type, a representative of the cause or soul which animates and unfolds it to the outer world. The outer senses are typical of the inner ones; for they are unfolded from the corresponding parts of the interior essence.
## 22: Davis (1847) 225 [2e-04]

>Again, the whole is composed of minute and particular parts; and the whole depends upon these for the harmonious results which are constantly occurring. It not only constitutes a system analogous —　to Nature, but it contains the specific forces and laws of procreation. Therefore, Man is a representative of the whole material Universe; and the laws which he constantly develops, correspond with the motions of matter and its reproducing effects, according to the law of Nature. Man first germinates, until finally the original Cause develops in his maturer condition, the principle of spiritual life; while he, again, as a material substance, reproduces his like. Consequently, he forms one grand circle of united action. Naturalists, anatomists, and physiologists, are aware that these general principles are established as irresistible truths; and as such they are made to subserve the purpose for which they are here used.
## 23: Davis (1847) 2029 [2e-04]

>From these considerations it is made clear that every human form possesses an organized interior principle by which the exterior is determined and developed. And as the body performs its use considered as a medium by which the inner man communicates with the outer world, so does the inner principle perform a use in establishing a connection with the interior world. So the human body individualizes the spirit in its relation to the outer world, while the spirit now connected with the body determines the perpetuity and identical existence of the spirit in its connection with the inner world, the spiritual form being also an expression of its interior soul. Thus it is that the soul is a prior organization; and when unfolding itself to the outer world, it only assumes a coating, a body, a form, suited to its existence in this rudimental sphere of material and spiritual creation.
## 24: Davis (1847) 2427 [3e-04]

>So with the human world: They are distributed in various portions of the earth, and in different climates, all surrounding, things in Nature being adapted to their peculiar constitutions, and congenial with their physical requirements. The law of association being the rudimental law of Nature, and flowing into and uniting all things, is fully developed in the human form. It constitutes men differently, gives them different passions, inclinations, and essences and properties of soul. It creates the diversity, the multifariousness, manifested in the human world. But although it makes men unlike each other, the variety is necessary to harmonize and unite the whole. The diversity manifests the order of development. It is the mode of perpetual progress, the cause of happiness, and the spring of all life and energy, of all passion and its gratification. Therefore the diversity is the order of Nature, the requirement of man, and the foundation of harmony.
## 25: Davis (1847) 592 [3e-04]

>Leaving, therefore, intermediate considerations for the work of scientific researches (which considerations cannot have any possible bearing upon the main principles established, I commence giving a general description of the vegetable and animal forms abounding upon the surface of Jupiter. By abstract dissertations upon these, the mind may be led to conceive of important truths by analogy; and the application of these truths will be of incalculable value in promoting the happiness and peace of the inhabitants of the earth. And that such application will be made, is by no means improbable. And when these things are impressed upon the internal principle of man, man will become generally enlightened; and an extensive knowledge of things existing, will unite his affections to Truth. And in proportion to the-extent of intelligence, will benevolence and happiness prevail.
## 26: Davis (1847) 115 [3e-04]

>δ 15. The laws that govern Nature go on with a steady and unchangeable progression. They are not at any time retarded or accelerated. Nothing can prevent the natural results of these laws. They are established by one great Positive Power and Mind, — and equaled by a negative or ultimate Equilibrium. Hence their continued and united forces, by the influence of which all things are actuated, governed, and developed, and pass on in a steady process of progression. Every particle of matter possesses the same power which governs the whole Universe; and in each particle you see a representation and evidence of these divine laws. Thus in the stone you may see the properties of the soil; in the soil, the properties of the plant; in the plant, the properties of an animal: in the animal you see Man, — and in Man you cannot see, but you can feel, the immortal principle.
## 27: Davis (1847) 2075 [3e-04]

>Love enjoys intercourse with the outer world by and through the medium of sensation. Were it not for this latter, commerce would not exist; for it is by this only that the human soul can sympathize with things on the outer, and conceive of uses adapted to its nature and constitution; and it is by this that the soul is enabled to enjoy the incessant inflowings of the elements of all material things. It is by this medium that Love breathes forth an affection for external things; and it is by this that the inner and the outer are enabled to associate with each other. Therefore, by Wisdom should Love be directed; and notwithstanding its conceptions and affections are ambiguous, eccentric, and imaginative, a well-developed Wisdom never permits an action of the Will before those affections are essentially modified, according to principles of utility.
## 28: Davis (1847) 1996 [3e-04]

>δ 177. The all-important truth to be established in the mind is, that the interior essence is the soul and creator of all external forms, which forms determine and demonstrate the mode of such soul's existence. The form which every particle of matter assumes, is that created and determined by the peculiar essence which is latent in the particle itself. A knowledge of this truth conveys to the mind a perfect conception of the interior, creative Cause of all things, and its attributes as displayed and developed in its external form. Motion being the first all-pervading principle, as derived from the Great Positive Mind, becomes the creator of all rudimental and elementary substances. Therefore Motion is the principle which gives to the mineral compounds their peculiar form, texture, and mode of existence.
## 29: Davis (1847) 2068 [3e-04]

>It is highly necessary, then, that the human mind should comprehend the great truth that nothing exists in the outer world except as it is produced and developed by an interior essence, and that of this essence the exterior is the perfect representative. Among all the various arts and sciences that now exist in the world, may be found demonstrations of this truth, and also of its vast importance. Forms do not exist with the mechanic or with the artist, merely as productions of the outer combinations of matter; but every form invented by man is a precise representative of the interior thought which is the cause of its creation. Every form is such as corresponds to the inward suggestion of Love, and is created by the living effort of Will, and modified and rendered perfect by the admonitions and directions of Wisdom.
## 30: Davis (1847) 2188 [3e-04]

>Such is the Second Sphere of human existence; and such substantially are its truths. The relation between it and the earth, and all earths, may be perceived by the similitude of external manifestations, these differing only in degrees of purity and development. And it is proper and advantageous that the human race should know and appreciate these truths, so that they may be induced to press onward and upward in the ascending scale of progress toward the great Fount of Love and Happiness. This is the object of the present relation, and it cannot well fail to perform its office: and when this is fulfilled, the race will be elevated to a high degree of social and moral culture, and thus all as one will be holy, happy, and perfect.
## 31: Davis (1847) 183 [3e-04]

>You now see that man possesses something besides Life and Sensation. And it is for the want of a capacity to make a proper distinction, that you confuse Motion, Life, Sensation, and Intelligence, in one form, and sanction the theory that Intelligence is a result of organization. The cause, then, of your belief is evidently demonstrated.　 —　It is for the want of a higher sphere to enable you to associate with that which belongs to your present sphere. But becoming confused in investigating your own composition, you arrive at the conclusion that the principle of mind is eternal, yet not individualized, or associating identically with spheres of ultimate progression, as corresponding with the spheres which you have demonstrated to your senses in the earthy, mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, with their minutiae and intermediates,　 —　and in primitive Motion, Life, Sensation, and Intelligence.
## 32: Davis (1847) 1083 [3e-04]

>If, then, it is impossible to understand the uses of the minute forms in Nature, is it not more impossible to comprehend the extent of an infinite thought? — and still more impossible to comprehend that thought's Originator? It is not well, then, to doubt the existence of a use in any department of Nature; for this would be evidence that the subject is not yet properly understood. And it is only when the exalted and sweeping intellect puts forth all its powers to grasp the whole united plan-work of Nature's creations, that a very indistinct idea is obtained of that which infinitely transcends all adequate conception. So nothing is inactive —nothing useless — nothing absolutely imperfect; but everything sustains an important position in the great architecture of the Univercoelum.
## 33: Davis (1847) 218 [3e-04]

>The proofs of such design are found in physiological indications — also in the astronomical and geological appearances, and the evident truths which each of these separately unfolds. And the whole combined forms proof of original adaptation of parts to produce results corresponding. But such design can only be known or comprehended by induction. And finding that each of these successive departments of Nature forms one circle, which is eternal, the conclusion irresistibly follows that their combined result (individual man) is equally so. Thus the Basis, or original Cause, is using Nature as an instrument, which may be termed an Effect, to produce Spirit as an End or Ultimate. — The Foundation, the Effect, and the Ultimate, are all eternal.
## 34: Davis (1847) 224 [3e-04]

>δ 27. Physiologists, in dissecting and analyzing the various parts of the human system, will discover principles corresponding to those in Nature. The anatomy is a framework which contains no useless parts. It is complicated but has not too many parts to produce the manifestations which are required, and to fill offices which it was the design to sustain. Each part is necessary to the perfection of the whole; the whole is necessary to the parts. The whole system is composed of organs, each of which gives to and takes from, every part that composes the system. There is a constant inspiration and exhalation —　a constant interchanging of particles going on throughout the whole organization; and thus the whole constantly produces and reproduces new particles, fitted to its progressive formation.
## 35: Davis (1847) 2071 [3e-04]

>The cause of, these metaphysical misconceptions, I repeat, lies in the fact that no substance, or compound, or mind, possesses within itself the power of self-investigation. The germ cannot understand its own qualities, but the perfect development can; because it is a higher and unfolded state of the qualities of the germ, and is thereby enabled to comprehend all below its exalted state of being. So the human mind can comprehend all that is below it, but cannot either comprehend itself or any higher degrees or spheres of animation. And thus, were it not that I am permitted to occupy a higher sphere of thought and observation, the soul would also appear to me as an indefinite and ambiguous consciousness which is neither to be comprehended as embracing any form, order, or substance, tangible to the senses.
## 36: Davis (1847) 130 [3e-04]

>All ultimates, to me, are still matter; but to you they are spirit. These appertain to the second Sphere, or ultimate condition, which I become associated with. As the natural senses are cognizant of forms, the spiritual senses are cognizant of their ultimates. Thus a particle of matter, in its ultimate perfection, cannot associate with a grosser particle; but when the grosser progresses to its ultimate, it becomes an associate with other ultimates. The rare acts on the lower; but the lower cannot act upon the rare. So with the mind — with the senses: they can progress in their inward nature to their unparticled or ultimate state; but the ultimate cannot associate with the senses. So psychological theories are only based upon desires of the mind, and convictions which it receives through the external senses.
## 37: Davis (1847) 1003 [3e-04]

>I am impressed by this knowledge of Nature not to accede to the external scientifics of the world, seeing that Nature should reveal her own interior truths, and that these are represented in every motion, form of life, and development of sensation. And these should be the external indices of the interior reality. I therefore endeavor, from the impressions thus received, to convey knowledge to others through their external senses by using the various knowledge of the world as instruments, whereby the foundation — the real reality — the only producing cause, of all external effects, may be apprehended. And as interior cause and external effect are manifested in all Nature, it is no more than proper and useful to prove one by the inseparable relation which it sustains to the other.
## 38: Davis (1847) 105 [3e-04]

>Let it further be considered that a physical manifestation is not produced until thought as a cause or prompter previously exists. Let it also be considered, that an idea or thought could not be produced without the mind previously existing. And let it further be impressed, that a mind could not be individualized without the previous existence of the physical organization; and still further, that the organization could not be constituted and established without its previous and eternal elementary existence; and that this all could not exist without a self-existent, unchangeable, and eternal Principle. Here, again, is developed the principle previously established: that the visible and external are effects and ultimates of invisible yet real producing causes.
## 39: Davis (1847) 1631 [3e-04]

>Moreover, if the laws instituted by Moses had been of celestial origin, then their effects would have absolutely corresponded. It is well to inquire of those who are familiar with the early ecclesiastical history of the world, whether such effects were universally experienced and manifested? If those laws originated in the Vortex from which Nature sprang, then their effects would have been in accordance with the divinity of the Cause, even as Nature unequivocally shows to be the case with herself. Again, if those laws were of human and imperfect origin, then their effects would manifest imperfection. It is well to inquire of those who reflect, whether this is not according to the invariable experience of all who are governed by arbitrary and human laws?
## 40: Davis (1847) 2005 [3e-04]

>The truth of this principle is manifested in every department of the material Universe, and especially in the various departments of material life. The mineral Body or world, displays the perfect complexion of its prompting essence. The vegetable displays, corresponds to, and represents, the character and quality of its Soul, which is Life. So with the whole animal Form; and so it is with Man. The interior or inner essence, in every instance, and without variation, is the soul, substance, creator, and cause, of all effects, which are the forms visible in the outer world. The external evidence of this truth consists in the appearances of all external forms; in the relations which they sustain to one another; in their invariable manifestations and developments, and in that general relation which they all sustain to the great structure of the material Universe.
## 41: Davis (1847) 287 [3e-04]

>As the First is the Omnipotent, Original, Positive Mind, and the Third, Spirit individualized and unparticled, constituting a corresponding intelligence, and approximating to higher spheres of intellectual perfection, these theories arise from mistaking the Effect (or Nature) for the Cause. They consequently darken the perception of future and corresponding spheres of intellectual existence; and their adherents take Nature as the Cause, Man as the Effect, and Mind as a natural result of physical organization. The first is visible: the last is thought to be also; for, taking external appearances for realities, and depending upon them as the only source of undisputable truth —　as ocular demonstration —　man loses sight of all connection between internal reality and temporal substances, and between body and spirit.
## 42: Davis (1847) 2014 [3e-04]

>Here, then, is the demonstration that essence determines, and unfolds itself into, its material form; and this displays the use and end for which the form is created. And inasmuch as essence is the parent and animator of material organizations, it therefore follows that each body is an external representation of its interior essence and creating cause. Man, then, in his material or outward form, is a perfect representation of the essence, quality, and individual structure of the spirit within. Thus the body is merely a coating, a garment, a sheathing of the spiritual principle, whereby the latter is enabled to communicate with all material things within its plane of existence, and meanwhile is the unchangeable type of the great End determined upon by the Divine Mind.
## 43: Davis (1847) 2091 [3e-04]

>The discerning mind will perceive instantly that this indicates a very superficial view of the cause of action in the animal and human form; and the hypothesis is assumed without analyzing the individual faculties of the human soul, and their specific modes of action. Man is only an elevated form among all the forms in Nature; and from the variety of which he is a part, the whole is made a complete system, in which may be observed series, degrees, and states of progression, both as relate to the essence and the form, or the soul and the body. But there exists no proof in the perceptible superiority of man over the lower creations that he possesses an independent power of action, while all other things in the Universe are inseparably and unchangeably united.
## 44: Davis (1847) 340 [3e-04]

>There is not one feature in Nature that presents itself to the general observer, which is not stamped with the impress of its divine origin. The same may be observed in every planet; in every form and sphere of the mineral and vegetable world; in every modification of anatomy and form in the plant. So also does the animal creation bear this indestructible impress, by its undeviating and unrestricted harmony, and its production and reorganization that are constantly going on, and are manifested throughout all its various spheres up to Mankind. And the physical and mental composition of man, his faculties and capacities, are still onward in their progressive tendency to their sublime results. And all these things are expressions　of unchangeable Truth, of divine Perfection, and of an eternal principle of divine Intelligence.
## 45: Davis (1847) 142 [3e-04]

>Facts have thus been presented in illustration of the condition and sphere of my inner life, to make it evident to the senses as corresponding to the sphere which you are now in, and to enable you to receive the truth by analogy. Being compelled to admit the visible facts, you are equally constrained to admit as probable, a correspondent or ultimate Sphere. Conclusions arrived at by independent processes are an evidence of its reality; though by no process of investigation now known, have you the means to prove demonstratively the sphere which I am at this time associated in. Therefore receive impressions favorable to its truth; for such impressions answer as a guide to your future progress in knowledge and truth.
## 46: Davis (1847) 2203 [3e-04]

>Every spirit has an exhalation or bodily atmosphere which is an exact indication of the quality and purity of its interiors; and thereby are all distinguished. For spheres are of every possible variety of color, according to the qualities of the spirits from which they emanate. Some have mingled colors, and some have only one. And it is also given me to know, that every natural earth, and that every mineral, vegetable, animal, man, and spirit — yea, that every particle of matter in the universe, has a peculiar sphere, by which it may be designated and recognized: — also, that every spiritual sphere, from the lowest to the highest, has a spherical emanation that describes its interior. It is surpassingly delightful to see those aromas and haloes of purity that surround every spirit.
## 47: Davis (1847) 348 [3e-04]

>The First and Last, or the Cause and Ultimate, which it has been the object to prove and demonstrate to the rational mind, is the existence, the reality, the true conception, of an intelligent First Cause (and this has been proved from all the palaetiological sciences, and all the philosophical inductions of Nature), and the positive individualization of the inner life, or spiritual principle. — And the last has been shown from the irresistible conclusions drawn from the physical sciences, together with philosophy, reason, and the approbations of a comprehensive intelligence, to be more than a probable possibility and actually demonstrated to be a real reality —　to be the natural result, but still a perfect and eternal one, of the material organization.
## 48: Davis (1847) 1441 [3e-04]

>The early inhabitants of the earth conceived that they lived upon a flattened sphere, sustained by as many huge living monsters as imagination could well conceive. They endeavored to comprehend, as the human mind is wont to do, the causes of things manifested. So they formed these chimerical conceptions; for they were not enlightened sufficiently to comprehend the truth, or to understand the principles upon which they and the Universe existed. So it became a universal belief that the earth was entirely motionless, not only because all external evidence seemed to demonstrate that conclusion, but because they could not believe that such a sphere could possibly revolve, and still remain in the same position, sustained by nothing.
## 49: Davis (1847) 135 [3e-04]

>Through such impressions, all things sought for appear present. The knowledge of the modus operandi of the Universe, from generals to particulars, is present with me. All this comes instinctively through an impressive connection with matter and ultimates. These principles instinctively perceived, to me appear realities, and all things else as superficial.* So this instinctive perception of truth enables me to communicate the knowledge of the second Sphere through the organization, to the external world. You may term this an expansion of the mind; a quickness of perception; an, exalted condition of the imagination. You may doubt its real truth; you may question the existence of the principle of which I speak; but you will not, if you consider the position which the true reasoner and philosopher sustains.
## 50: Davis (1847) 1084 [3e-04]

>These meditations are the result of the breathings of the sphere of Causes,* in which my mind is situated, and in which all effects are made present. And these effects are exemplified in every minute particle, constituting an inseparable chain of correspondences ascending to the highest celestial spheres, which are illuminated only with divine Love and Wisdom. All that is around, below, above, is to my mind a harmonious congregation of forms and spheres, of laws and principles, which are in every particular displaying the original design of the infinite and omnipotent Mind. So no thought is so extensive or so profound as to comprehend the infinite expanse of divine creations.
## 51: Davis (1847) 2450 [3e-04]

>And the various departments of society will represent the Solar System also in their mutual exchangings of purified and perfected particles. In other words, persons in the first society who advance and become capable of associating with the second, must be permitted to ascend and occupy the positions in the scale of progressive development for which they have become qualified. And let this mutual exchange be continued through all the groups, even up to the central power. And he who arrives there first by natural qualification will succeed to the throne of government. And so there will be a constant supply of particles (or persons), both at the seat of government and at the extremities of society.
## 52: Davis (1847) 140 [3e-04]

>Admit mind and its future identity — and you then can conceive of thought being irrevocable, and existing in repetition and association with the form, or cause of its production. Individual perception establishes this truth: That a thought once produced, never requires reproduction: but it is only necessary to associate the mind with the cause of its first development, to renew or refresh its action. Mind, therefore, corresponds to a fulcrum, upon which operates the lever of producing thought, which revolves, in its action, the principles and associations of ideas which thoughts seek to conceive. Then a repetition of thoughts once produced, creates as an ultimate, or effect, accompanying new ones.
## 53: Davis (1847) 2055 [3e-04]

>δ 184. From the faculty of Love, as the basis of the soul, flows the faculty of WILL. This then becomes the mediatorial faculty of the human mind, and is the means employed by Love to accomplish whatever end it desires. Herein are made plain the three moving principles engaged in accomplishing any end conceived of and' desired. Love perceives and conceives that which is congenial to, its affections. The end to be attained is the cause of Love's prompting the Will to act upon the body in order to accomplish it. In other words, Will is employed as a means by Love to attain this end: for which it has an affection.
## 54: Davis (1847) 2232 [3e-04]

>Countless millions dwell in each society in each Sphere — more than numbers can express. Yet the combined numbers dwelling in all subordinate Spheres would not form any comparison with one-half of one society that dwells in this Super-Celestial home! How inconceivable, therefore, must be the immensity of each, society in this Sphere, inasmuch as the half of one society comprises more individuals than all the created forms that animate all the subordinate Spheres of universal space! Yet creation has just begun: Love is just born, Will is just conceived, and Wisdom is in the germ yet undeveloped!
## 55: Davis (1847) 2063 [3e-04]

>Will, then, is the perfection of Love, and hence receives, contains, and continually manifests, all the qualities, thoughts, affections, and desires of Love. And Wisdom is the perfect form of them both, because Wisdom is an ultimate progression of them; and it is a representation of all their latent qualities and unexpressed affections. Wisdom — is that faculty of the soul which gives order and form to all things in the outer world; and Love gives to order and form light, life, taste, grace, and elegance. And Will is the executive faculty between Wisdom and Love, and obeys perpetually the suggestions of Love as these are sanctioned by Wisdom.
## 56: Davis (1847) 279 [3e-04]

>The extremes also impress him with the conclusion, that the innumerable capacities, powers of perception, and spheres of association into which mankind are divided, have no foundation in Nature or her laws. He is in a condition to perceive the great disconnection between Nature's established laws, and man's present ignorance, imperfection, and grossness. In the former, he is impressed with the immutable and imperishable harmony and truth which are constantly and openly manifested; and in, the latter, he sees general, superficial, and erroneous conceptions of the principles of organic life, —　and still a greater perversion of the affections, the understanding, and the inward principles, which constitute the spiritual nature of man.
## 57: Davis (1847) 790 [3e-04]

>The term “sensation," as applied to life, vitality, or a minute degree of motion, is altogether improper; for sensation is as distinct from life as life is from motion. For sensation is the principle that connects the inner life, or spirit, with the external body. Life may exist, where sensation does not. The phenomenon of life should be understood as a mere ascension of the principle of Motion, —this developing inherent energies, and causing an imperceptible transmutation and reproduction of the substance in which the principle exists. Such, therefore, was the character and condition of the forms developed at this period.
## 58: Davis (1847) 2010 [3e-04]

>But instead of the body creating and developing the spirit, the spirit is first organized, individualized, and potentialized. From it is unfolded the outer, or the organization. The latter thus becomes an instrument by and through which the interior principle or form, communicates with the material world. Therefore, the body is only a mode, a form, by and through which the spirit or essence displays itself to the outer world. Thus it is that the body is in constant subordination. While the spirit enfolds itself in a material form, it likewise exerts the most absolute power over every portion of its outward form, and is perpetually distributing motion, life, and sensation, throughout all the avenues and recesses of the same.
## 59: Davis (1847) 282 [3e-04]

>To the searcher and observer of external manifestations, the Universe is a symbol, a type of that which was and is, and of that which must and will be. Hence, taking Nature as truth, it carries these convictions, — which have been heretofore impressed. Like all other mediums, it must be truth, or it could not be a medium. It answers as a guide to internal meditation, and as a subject of external contemplation. Therefore, the First and Ultimate of all things are rational and irresistible inductions that can be drawn from the prolific, fertile, and truthful experience and meditation of the true artist, and who associates with Nature's inimitable beauties.
## 60: Davis (1847) 298 [3e-04]

>δ 37. For a proper comprehension of the QUALITIES and ATTRIBUTES contained in the Great Fountain of Causation, and unfolded in the various stages of material progression, it cannot be inappropriate to appeal to visible and invisible truths and facts in Nature and experience. And by receiving almost the whole truth in reference to the First Cause, and the various attributes of its nature, the mind would be prepared to enter the higher stages or spheres of the Revelation: and this would also prepare the mind, if well-constituted and directed, to perceive the close and connected order of development existing between the Beginning and the End of all things.
## 61: Davis (1847) 769 [3e-04]

>Nature contains all the forces necessary to institute all the conditions, and to produce all the developments, that occur in the earth and on its surface. And by properly conceiving of a uniformity in Nature's laws, we can form an adequate conception of the successive developments that are the results of such. On this basis we may establish a law of teleology; and upon this we may repose, having the most perfect confidence in the workings of Nature's principles, in suitable combinations, in the production of the various developments. And thus we may have a steady, unchanging, and unerring guide, whereby we may be enabled to associate our thoughts and aspirations with the higher states of the ascending laws.
## 62: Davis (1847) 2002 [3e-04]

>The mode by which Sensation exists in its relation to the outer world, consists only in the structure of the whole animal creation. The mode by which Motion, Life, and Sensation, exist as one united essence and Soul in its relation to the material world, consists only in the perfect stricture of the human organization. Then it is not the body, the form, the material, that develops and organizes the spiritual principles: for if this were true, then indeed the human mind could not sustain its identity as disconnected from the instrument by which it was developed. This would likewise be unfailingly true of all material organizations and their living principles.
## 63: Davis (1847) 1422 [4e-04]

>The process by which man may become acquainted with these laws, is by analyzing external, physical manifestations, and discovering their interior cause and governing principle. It has been established that external and visible effects cannot be depended upon as indicating their own interior cause; but that to become acquainted with the cause, the effect or form must be analyzed. By becoming acquainted with the interior and moving principles of Nature, we become acquainted with the elements of the Divine Mind, and also with the universal designs of the latter. These designs are the effects and developments constantly manifested throughout Nature.
## 64: Davis (1847) 209 [4e-04]

>It being established as indisputable (yet as an idea too vast for ordinary comprehension) that Matter possesses Motion inherently, and that the whole contains the substance and properties to produce all things, you, by admitting this, adopt the belief in the possibility of future progression; and by admitting such a possibility, you are compelled (in consistency) to remain quiet until I trace generally and particularly, from the Great Positive Mind, the Cause, Effect, and Ultimate, of all things: and this will exhibit the infinite progression of all particles in existence, and show that this progression develops the principle so long involved in obscurity, viz., SPIRIT.
## 65: Davis (1847) 184 [4e-04]

>And in this place it is necessary to impress again the proposition, that no substance or power of any character, whether physical or intellectual, possesses within itself the power of self-investigation or comprehension. Therefore you can comprehend and trace, analogically and correctly, grosser substances to the formation of yourselves; but you arrive at Mind, Intelligence, Spirit, —and though this is the principle which has enabled you to explore and comprehend all below it, you find that this itself is necessarily vague and indefinite to you. And hence there is either too much belief as respects this principle and its composition, or too much disbelief; and each is a natural consequence of a principle attempting to investigate itself.
## 66: Davis (1847) 223 [4e-04]

>Therefore each part must of necessity constitute an essential substance, and accomplish a particular object; and thus the arch is rendered perfect. But if any part did not perfectly unite with the other parts, and with the general formation, the whole would be internally and externally confused and disorganized. It consequently forms, as a whole, a perfect Structure; and in particulars it is constituted of the various particles and substances, as means, effects, and instruments, to develop and unite the whole, so that a perfect system may be formed, to accomplish the ultimate design of the original Contemplator!
## 67: Davis (1847) 1081 [4e-04]

>It is seen by this that universal truth displays a universal correspondence. All things, therefore, are existing externally in forms, but all realities are dwelling in the interior, and are the cause of the form's existence. Thus it is necessary for the living principle of man to have an external form: for the two mutually depend upon each other. Without the form, the spirit could not be: and without the spirit, there could be no form. Therefore the interior is the reality, and the form is a useful, rudimental instrument, agent, or medium, by which the spirit forms a connection with the material Universe.
## 68: Davis (1847) 1247 [4e-04]

>δ 86. It is impossible to trace the etymologies of each tongue, inasmuch as there are so many varieties of idioms and dialects, and even of conceptions and thoughts by which etymologies have been determined. And it would be of no utility to refer to the researches of glaciologists and etymologists; for each of these, in all his investigations, has only accumulated local, external facts, with the intention of establishing some particular hypothesis. And deductions made from facts thus accumulated are not warrantable nor useful as a guide to inquiries respecting the origin and primitive form of language, and the process by which it has assumed its present innumerable modifications.
## 69: Davis (1847) 288 [4e-04]

>The connection thus broken cannot be united in a mind thus observing Nature. The result has been to throw upon the world theories misconceived and misconstructed. But by observing (through the power of analysis) the invisible, the reality of all things, and taking this as a basis of reasoning, — by virtue of a concentration and analogical application of the mind to the subject under consideration, and by tracing distinctively, collectively, generically, progressively, and universally, all things, — the conclusion becomes irresistible, that Spirit must exist as an absolutely necessary result of the nature, essence, and composition, of the Supreme and Omnipotent Production!
## 70: Davis (1847) 2019 [4e-04]

>The use of every organized substance is displayed in its external relations to all inferior and superior constitutions of matter; and it depends upon them for its existence and its capacity to fulfill the use and accomplish the end for which it was designed. Forms of all series and classifications contain in themselves evidence of their use to the material world; and they also determine the specific degrees of uniform and ceaseless progression. A series of forms is merely a congregation of organic beings of one type, from the lowest form through the successive modifications, to the highest; all of which compose one full and decided degree of organization.
## 71: Davis (1847) 161 [4e-04]

>Nature and her forms present more evidence in favor of a ceaseless and unchangeable motion in matter than otherwise. There is no such thing existing as positive inertia in matter. It is not particular in what way matter is developed; it is not particular whether activity in any form of matter is directly manifest to the senses or not —activity in such nevertheless does exist; for universal motion may be demonstrated as a general and positive law of Nature. Then why take particulars and minutiae in evidence of the opposite?
## 72: Davis (1847) 157 [4e-04]

>Again: First, facts have been presented; secondly, established truths corresponding with facts; and thirdly, representation — sustaining the two former by appeals made to visible and external truths, independent of belief or disbelief. These becoming manifest, not only establish facts as corresponding with facts, but the first two confirm the last, and the last represents and confirms all. All this is positively sustaining the truth which was first apparently presumed to exist in the phenomenon termed Clairvoyance.
## 73: Davis (1847) 190 [4e-04]

>First, the form is a representative of Matter originally existing; for the system is formed by laws not distinctly comprehended, even as is the great system of the Universe. There is an invisible, an internal cause, existing in the human form; and there is an external, an ultimate, an end also. These two are generals; but there are other specific qualities and essences, producing distinct results; —　and a classification of these is necessary in order to make them familiar to the mind, as corresponding with distinct departments in Nature.
## 74: Davis (1847) 111 [4e-04]

>The ultimate perfection of all substances, the ethereal existence of spiritual spheres, and the means by which I receive impressions are evident to me; but so greatly different from anything familiar to the natural mind, acting through the organization, that it is impossible at this moment to make these things evident to your senses. But I must reveal these things as the impressions are received: the parallel facts and inductive conclusions will be made evident to your minds hereafter. And I must proceed to give the appearances of all second spheres as they are to me manifested.
## 75: Davis (1847) 1651 [4e-04]

>The proposition should be well considered, that no judgment ever has, or ever can be, convinced of the truth of the miraculous conception. And this is presumptive evidence upon which to predicate the conclusion that the idea in question is untrue. For the reasoning faculty is unfolded as a result of an immutable law, a law that is pure and divine. Consequently, the judgment — the reason —the intellect of man — must be correspondingly divine; and therefore whatever it cannot sanction, the Divine Mind never created.
## 76: Davis (1847) 276 [4e-04]

>Thus the experience and conviction of every true artist; the impressive lessons which he receives from the various symbols and types of internal beauty and perfection; the subduing effect and controlling and tranquillizing action which these have upon his disposition; the general appearances of things, and the indestructible union which he perceives existing between all particles composing the mass of the material existence; the confidence which he is enabled to repose in Nature, and the internal design manifested on the external all go to establish the main truths and conclusions which it is necessary to impress.
## 77: Davis (1847) 2108 [4e-04]

>And I feel authorized to affirm, from the nature of my impressions, that if man were differently situated and superiorly educated, he would not be so far removed from the spiritual world as he now is in his sphere of thought. And, moreover, he would recognize the proper use of all things, and apply them to his wants, as directed by the governor of all things, which is Wisdom. And he would recognize the relation existing between the natural and the spiritual world; and that, too, without experiencing a metamorphosis or transformation of the real man from the outer to the inner world.
## 78: Davis (1847) 166 [4e-04]

>And could man constantly unite with his body substances and matter which are not active, or which do not possess a living principle? Food is constantly taken; it is active upon the body; it becomes a part of the texture and substance of the system —　is subjected to the physiological operations, and is governed by the same mutual motive forces that pervade all things. If matter were inactive, could it be associated with activity? Can motion and rest exist together?
## 79: Davis (1847) 232 [4e-04]

>And man contains all this evidence combined within his own physical constitution. Yet it would be impossible for him, in his present sphere of existence, to have the subject of a future life demonstrated to his senses. Therefore, he contemplates Nature and her laws, as invisibly and eternally producing results according to their inherent qualities and forces. And yet the highest and most important subject, and the one most desirable to comprehend, is the principle, the substance, the inward reality which constitutes the ultimate existence of the contemplator!
## 80: Davis (1847) 694 [4e-04]

>It is now manifest to every enlarged understanding, that the lowest typifies the highest; and the very moment you conceive of such a representation, all idea of opposites is annihilated. And as the first must exist before the ultimate, so all things must harmonize perfectly, and conform to the established law of universal and eternal progression. Therefore opposites do not exist; but that which is gross, and imperfect, and apparently opposed to higher developments, merely has not progressed to the standard of perfection that we have erected.
## 81: Davis (1847) 2023 [4e-04]

>Therefore the use of forms in in their second degree of external being, is to convey the inferior particles of matter, constituting their own and lower compositions, to higher planes of organic development. Forms, in every case, are mediums of communication between the lower degrees of matter and the highest organization in Nature, which is Man. And forming, as they do, this medium, they constitute of the whole system of the outer world a harmonious and inseparable creation, all parts of which are mutually dependent upon each other.
## 82: Davis (1847) 2459 [4e-04]

>From this the human world will receive a Form — which will be the fullness of the stature of a perfect Man. And this Form will be the great exterior representative of interior love and industry, and also the mode by and through which the great Soul of Mankind will commune with the excellences of higher Spheres. Then Order and Form will be established, which are representatives of Wisdom — such as will emanate from the centre of social government, and spread distributive justice over the earth.
## 83: Davis (1847) 134 [4e-04]

>So with my inner life or ultimate sphere: it associates with the ultimates or realities of all grosser substances; and by such a connection, traces subjects analytically yet instantaneously from cause to effect; and this supplies me with the knowledge which to your minds and understanding bears the impress of being derived from direct supernatural and spiritual intercourse —while to me the word " supernatural" has no meaning. All natural things cannot produce supernatural; but this term is only applied to effects when their causes are not evident.
## 84: Davis (1847) 203 [4e-04]

>But resting on the foundation of such a conclusion irresistibly established, the mind cannot but look at the whole of Nature as producing grand effects in an infinite process of progression; and observe adaptation of means to ends, as displaying external proof of design. It cannot fail to perceive that each part is necessary to the composition and structure of the Whole; and that the Whole, of necessity, must be composed of parts; and that each part performs its specific office in producing and developing new effects and ultimates.
## 85: Davis (1847) 681 [4e-04]

>And as they are now existing, they show forth all the results naturally arising from a degraded situation and a depressed intellect. They are in a more unfavorable condition than the inhabitants of any other planet: but still, in the general contemplation, they are uses for the accomplishment of more perfect ends. They are rudimental materials that are gradually ascending to higher stages of refinement; but only as elements disunite, the highest from the lowest, and ascend　to enter into new and more perfect forms.
## 86: Davis (1847) 1463 [4e-04]

>Moses, ascending to manhood with a healthy and athletic constitution, and in possession of many superior intellectual endowments, soon began to teach learnedly, attributing his impressions to the influence of the Lord's invisible spirit, in accordance with the general conviction of those times. This, in fact, was the first opinion that was enstamped upon his mind in youth; and in manhood the same became fully developed. Notwithstanding this error, he was far more intellectual than almost any other person at those times.
## 87: Davis (1847) 2041 [4e-04]

>WISDOM is the perfection of Love. It is the sealing element of the human soul; it is the establishment of the soul's perfect constitution. Wisdom flows from love, is directed by experience, modified by will, and rendered perfect by knowledge. Wisdom is the thinking principle, the faculty that cogitates, investigates, searches, and explores, the fields of terrestrial and celestial existence. It is the faculty that analyzes, calculates, and imperatively commands obedience from all the subordinate possessions of Will and Love.
## 88: Davis (1847) 137 [4e-04]

>δ17. Thus grosser matter, or rudimental beings, and their progression until they arrive at their ultimate perfection, are in correspondence with mind and its progress to its ultimate sphere. Their many spheres and associations are only such as mark the natural refinement or progression of all things. Intellectual progress commences in the body or first individualization: thence the mind goes onward through its many stages of knowledge, corresponding to the various stages of its ultimate progression.
## 89: Davis (1847) 654 [4e-04]

>This knowledge, being pure and truthful, begets an affection; and thoughts constantly flowing out from their interior knowledge of truth and reality, unite themselves with this affection. Hence mind corresponds to knowledge, and knowledge corresponds to thought and affection as the ultimate.* Therefore an affection for thoughts exists among them. And the conceptions arising in their minds are always inevitably true. And from their high veneration arises an affection for truths, which is regarded among them as a celestial affection. This therefore is their interior condition.
## 90: Davis (1847) 814 [4e-04]

>The opinions of geologists are in some particulars very dissimilar and very incorrect. But geologists are nevertheless worthy of the approbation of the world for endeavoring to unfold truths that might lead to a proper comprehension of the origin of the earth. And I do not therefore feel impressed to contradict any of their theories or propositions, but merely to state the truth, in order that that which they have not discovered may be correctly inferred from the evidence presented in this course of generalization, the basis of which they will not dispute.
## 91: Davis (1847) 1080 [4e-04]

>And it is only by a clear comprehension of Nature's creations that we can form any correct conception of even a Thought emanating from the divine Mind. The laws of Nature are known to be unchangeable; and these are merely the expressions of divine Thoughts. These laws, therefore, are emanations from the universal Cause; and by resting upon their immutable and harmonious results, we would be resting our interior affections upon the Thoughts of an all-pervading, infinitely-perfect, omnipotent Mind.
## 92: Davis (1847) 2058 [4e-04]

>If a man has in view the construction of a beautiful edifice, the exterior and interior portions of which are perfectly defined in the mind, it is because he has first conceived of the uses which the edifice with its various portions may fulfill. And as it is the use that plans and arranges the whole construction, it may be said that the plan of the edifice, as to proposed form and appearance, precisely corresponds to, and represents, the use, the conception of which was the cause of the plan's being instituted.
## 93: Davis (1847) 4 [4e-04]

>The physical and mental organization of man enforces the conclusion that there are no possible limits to social progress and spiritual' attainment and elevation: for man is a microcosm, or, a combined expression of all the perfections contained in the Divine essence that animates and preserves the harmony of the Universe. Upon the constitution of man, who is a type of Divine wisdom, are based those important principles which, when duly comprehended, will construct of the whole world one Brotherhood.
## 94: Davis (1847) 2066 [4e-04]

>The Great Divine Mind, in essence, is Love: this is the light and life of the Universe. The Universe itself is the Body of Love, and its perfect Form. But Wisdom is the highest attribute, and the great ultimate of eternal Design. And Wisdom gives to Light and Life a Body — and to this Body, Order and Form. The whole is rendered thereby a harmonious System, each outward form being a perfect representative of its creative cause.
## 95: Davis (1847) 117 [5e-04]

>It is impossible by words, to convey a full and adequate conception of the manner in which I arrive at truth. I can only employ such words as convey all the idea that words can convey, of this process. My information is not derived from any persons that exist in the sphere into which my mind enters, but it is the result of a Law of truth, emanating from the Great Positive Mind, and pervading all spheres of existence. By this, truth is attracted to, and is received by, the mind.
## 96: Davis (1847) 247 [5e-04]

>Hence the Whole, in a broad and comprehensive sense, is necessary to the mutual and perpetual action of all particles, which leads to the perfection of matter and fits it to sustain the physiological structure, symmetry, and beauty of the whole animal kingdom. This represents Nature in all spheres of anterior production and procreation. It bears a correspondence to the teachings of every other science, —　and distinctly points to the original Focus and Fountain of Spiritual Intelligence which is thus universally manifested.
## 97: Davis (1847) 316 [5e-04]

>Accompanying each of these developments, were corresponding productions of vegetable and animal life. And whether the chain is unbroken from the first development of living species to those which now exist, is a question which has no essential bearing upon the inductions legitimately received; for the generalization of the geological and physiological sciences leads to corresponding universal truths. Therefore the orderly development of the earth, and of accompanying and corresponding organic beings, manifests unspeakable Wisdom and Design!
## 98: Davis (1847) 959 [5e-04]

>The reflections prompted by an enlarged understanding of Nature and her laws cannot be too deep, or be extended too far back into the period of animated existence, to be the means of useful instruction. All the forms, elements, and compositions, abounding upon the face of the earth at this period, can be made useful in unfolding an understanding of the present developments. But these can be of use in this way only as we conceive of the law of correspondence.
## 99: Davis (1847) 1002 [5e-04]

>Thus let the philosophic mind observe Nature as a reflection of her interior principles, but let not the reflection — the external — be considered as the reality. And let it be impressed that all interior essences tend to clothe themselves in external forms, and that thus internal and external, which again are composed of innumerable parts, compose a perfect Whole — and that the whole thus represents some higher degrees and more perfect forms, not yet comprehended.
## 100: Davis (1847) 2021 [5e-04]

>Three distinct uses are discoverable in the forms in the outer world. Their first and subordinate use is to establish the mode in and by which all essence may exist, and preserve its identity of unceasing life and energy: also to constitute of the material world a grand, perfect, and harmonious System, the whole of which is an exterior demonstration of the interior harmony contained in all essential elements of Divine Love, Divine Life, and Divine Wisdom.
