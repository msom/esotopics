## 1: Blavatsky (1888) 2234 [0.9832]

>702 It is this Trinity that is allegorized by the “Three Steps of Vishnu,” which mean—Vishnu being considered as the Infinite in exotericism—that from Parabrahman issued Mûlaprakriti, Purusha (the Logos) and Prakriti; the four forms—with itself, the synthesis—of Vâch. And in the Kabalah, Ain Suph, Shekinah, Adam Kadmon and Sephira, the four, or the three, emanations being distinct—yet One.
## 2: Blavatsky (1888) 1616 [0.9736]

>The indestructible and the destructible, such is the double manifestation of the Self. Of these the indestructible is the existent [the true essence or nature of Self, the underlying principles], the manifestation as an individual (entity) is called the destructible.
## 3: Blavatsky (1888) 720 [0.9661]

>The seventh being Malkuth, which is our Earth on its plane, and the lowest on all the other planes of conscious existence. The Chaldean Book of Numbers contains a detailed explanation of all this.
## 4: Blavatsky (1888) 714 [0.9478]

>(a) The phrase, “through the Seven Worlds of Mâyâ,” refers here to the seven Globes of the Planetary Chain and the seven Rounds, or the forty-nine stations of active existence that are before the “Spark,” or Monad, at the beginning of every Great Life‐Cycle, or Manvantara. The “Thread of Fohat” is the Thread of Life before referred to.

>These Dhyân Chohans, as we see, do not pass through the three kingdoms as do the lower Pitris; nor do they incarnate in man until the Third Root Race. Thus, as the teaching stands:
## 6: Blavatsky (1888) 2161 [0.9143]

>285 Occultism divides the periods of Rest (Pralaya) into several kinds: there is the Individual Pralaya of each Globe, as humanity and life pass on to the next—seven minor Pralayas in each Round; the Planetary Pralaya, when seven Rounds are completed; the Solar Pralaya, when the whole system is at an end; and finally the Universal Pralaya, Mahâ or Brahmâ Pralaya, at the close of the Age of Brahmâ. These are the chief Pralayas or “destruction periods.” There are many other minor ones, but with these we are not concerned at present.
## 7: Blavatsky (1888) 2119 [0.8956]

>84 Hence Non‐Being is “Absolute Being,” in Esoteric Philosophy. In the tenets of the latter even Âdi‐Buddha (the First or Primeval Wisdom) is, while manifested, in one sense an Illusion, Mâyâ, since all the gods, including Brahmâ, have to die at the end of the Age of Brahmâ; the abstraction called Parabrahman—whether we call it Ain Suph, or with Herbert Spencer the Unknowable—alone being the One Absolute Reality. The One Secondless Existence is Advaita, “Without a Second,” and all the rest is Mâyâ, so teaches the Advaita Philosophy.
## 8: Blavatsky (1888) 656 [0.8900]

>(7.) The Seventh Spirit, the last emanated from the “Mother,” appears as the first divine human form distinctly male and female. It was the seventh “creation,” as in the Purânas, wherein man is the seventh creation of Brahmâ.

>2. The Dhyânis [Pitris] are those who have evolved their Bhuta [Doubles] from themselves, which Rûpa [Form] has become the vehicle of Monads [Seventh and Sixth principles] that had completed their cycle of transmigration in the three preceding Kalpas [Rounds]. Then, they [the Astral Doubles] became the men of the first Human Race of the Round. But they were not complete, and were senseless.
## 11: Blavatsky (1888) 109 [0.8717]

>What is it that ever is?—Space, the eternal Anupâdaka [Parentless]. What is it that ever was?—The Germ in the Root. What is it that is ever coming and going?—The Great Breath. Then, there are three Eternals?—No, the three are one. That which ever is is one, that which ever was is one, that which is ever being and becoming is also one: and this is Space.
## 12: Blavatsky (1888) 641 [0.8676]

>The chief Hierarchies among these are hinted at in the great Quaternary, or the “four bodies and the three faculties,” exoterically, of Brahmâ and the Panchâsya, the five Brahmâs, or the five Dhyâni‐Buddhas in the Buddhist system.

>5. Or the Spiritual, in contradistinction to the personal Self. The student must not confuse this Spiritual Ego with the "HIGHER SELF" which is Atma, the God within us, and inseparable from the Universal Spirit. (return to text)
## 14: Blavatsky (1888) 465 [0.8672]

>5. Every Life‐Cycle on Globe D (our Earth) is composed of seven Root-Races. They commence with the ethereal and end with the spiritual, on the double line of physical and moral evolution—from the beginning of the Terrestrial Round to its close. One is a “Planetary Round” from Globe A to Globe G, the seventh; the other, the “Globe Round,” or the Terrestrial.
## 15: Blavatsky (1888) 2195 [0.8596]

>493 The manifested Spirit: Absolute, Divine Spirit is one with absolute Divine Substance; Parabrahman and Mûlaprakriti are one in essence. Therefore, Cosmic Ideation and Cosmic Substance, in their primal character, are one also.
## 16: Blavatsky (1888) 235 [0.8554]

>All this, teaches the Hidden Science, is but the temporary reflection, the shadow of the eternal ideal prototype in Divine Thought; the word “Eternity,” note well again, standing here only in the sense of “Æon,” as lasting throughout the seemingly interminable, but still limited cycle of activity, called by us Manvantara. For what is the real esoteric meaning of Manvantara, or rather a Manu‐antara? It means, literally, “between two Manus,” of whom there are fourteen in every Day of Brahmâ, such a Day consisting of 1,000 aggregates of four Ages, 1,000 “Great Ages” or Mahâyugas. Let us now analyse the word or name Manu. Orientalists in their dictionaries tell us that the term “Manu” is from the root man, “to think”; hence “the thinking man.” But, esoterically, every Manu, as an anthropomorphized patron of his special cycle (or Round), is but the personified idea of the “Thought Divine” (as the Hermetic Pymander); each of the Manus, therefore, being the special god, the creator and fashioner of all that appears during his own respective cycle of being or Manvantara. Fohat runs the Manus’ (or Dhyân Chohans’) errands, and causes the ideal prototypes to expand from within without—that is, to cross gradually, on a descending scale, all the planes, from the noumenal to the lowest phenomenal, to bloom finally on the last into full objectivity—the acme of Illusion, or the grossest matter.
## 17: Blavatsky (1888) 135 [0.8539]

>The seven Stanzas given in this volume represent the seven terms of this abstract formula. They refer to, and describe, the seven great stages of the evolutionary process, which are spoken of in the Purânas as the “Seven Creations,” and in the Bible as the “Days” of Creation.

>1. ... LISTEN, YE SONS OF THE EARTH, TO YOUR INSTRUCTORS—THE SONS OF THE FIRE (a). LEARN THERE IS NEITHER FIRST NOR LAST; FOR ALL IS ONE NUMBER, ISSUED FROM NO‐NUMBER (b).

>758 They may indeed mark a “special” or extra “creation,” since it is they who, by incarnating themselves within the senseless human shells of the two first Root‐Races, and a great portion of the Third Root‐Race, create, so to speak, a new race: that of thinking, self‐conscious and divine men.

>How does Fohat build them? He collects the Fiery‐Dust. He makes Balls of Fire, runs through them, and round them, infusing life thereïnto, then sets them into motion; some one way, some the other way. They are cold, he makes them hot. They are dry, he makes them moist. They shine, he fans and cools them. Thus acts Fohat from one Twilight to the other, during Seven Eternities.

>HOW DOES FOHAT BUILD THEM? HE COLLECTS THE FIERY‐DUST.

>1037 This is a mistake, which implies a material agent, distinct from the influences which move it, i.e., blind matter and perhaps “God” again, whereas this One Life is the very God and Gods “Itself.”

>Can we not therefore represent the different organs by the different thickness of the prism, the different transformations of the unique force by the refracted rays, and the unique force itself by the parallel lines?
## 7: Blavatsky (1888) 1573 [0.9270]

>How does the Universe move in this case, and how do its forces correlate? A world built on absolutely non‐elastic atoms, is like an engine without steam, it is doomed to eternal inertia.
## 8: Blavatsky (1888) 1909 [0.9234]

>The Monads [of Leibnitz] may from one point of view be called force, from another matter. To Occult Science, force and matter are only two sides of the same substance.

>The Satan of Materialism now laughs at all alike, and denies the visible as well as the invisible. Seeing in light, heat, electricity, and even in the phenomenon of life, only properties inherent in Matter, it laughs whenever life is called the Vital Principle, and derides the idea of its being independent of and distinct from the organism.
## 14: Blavatsky (1888) 1832 [0.8704]

>But this is not all. Even the greatest philosopher of England—Mr. Herbert Spencer—arrayed himself against this fantastic theory by saying that (a) “The problem of existence is not resolved” by it; (b) the nebular hypothesis “throws no light upon the origin of diffused matter”; and (c) that “the nebular hypothesis (as it now stands) implies a First Cause.”
## 15: Blavatsky (1888) 1919 [0.8704]

>And behold a great scholar in Science now asking the world to accept this as one of his postulates! We have shown the “Mother,” fiery and hot, becoming gradually cool and radiant, and this same Scientist claims as his second postulate—a scientific necessity, it would seem—
## 16: Kardec (1857) 9 [0.8685]

>The word vitality does not express the same idea. According to some, the vital principle is a property of matter, produced wherever matter is found under specifc conditions. In contrast, most believe that it resides in a special, universally circulated fuid, of which each being absorbs a portion during life. This effect can be compared to how inert bodies absorb light. This is the vital fuid, which is generally regarded as being the same as the animalized electric fuid, also known as magnetic fuid, nervous fuid, and so on.
## 17: Blavatsky (1888) 1794 [0.8677]

>Another of the fallacies, from the Occult standpoint, embodied in the modern theory as it now stands, is the hypothesis that the Planets were all detached from the Sun; that they are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh; whereas the Sun and the Planets are only co‐uterine brothers, having the same nebular origin, but in a different mode from that postulated by modern Astronomy.

>The Archæus is an essence that is equally distributed in all parts of the human body.... The Spiritus Vitæ takes its origin from the Spiritus Mundi. Being an emanation of the latter, it contains the elements of all cosmic influences, and is therefore the cause by which the action of the stars [cosmic forces] upon the invisible body of man [his vital Linga Sharîra] may be explained.
## 20: Blavatsky (1888) 1587 [0.8452]

>The hypothesis of Metcalfe respecting sun‐force and earth‐force is not only very simple, but most fascinating.... Here are two elements in the universe, the one is ponderable matter.... The second element is the all‐pervading ether, solar fire. It is without weight, substance, form, or colour; it is matter infinitely divisible, and its particles repel each other; its rarity is such that we have no word, except ether, by which to express it. It pervades and fills space, but alone it too is quiescent—dead. We bring together the two elements, the inert matter, the self‐repulsive ether [?] and thereupon dead [?] ponderable matter is vivified; [Ponderable matter may be inert but never dead—this is Occult Law.] ... through the particles of the ponderable substance the ether [Ether’s second principle] penetrates, and, so penetrating, it combines with the ponderable particles and holds them in mass, holds them together in bond of union; they are dissolved in the ether.

>According to Christian the twenty-two major arcana of the Tarot represent the hieroglyphic paintings which are found in the spaces between the columns of a gallery, which the neophyte was obliged to cross in the Egyptian initiations. There were twelve columns to the North and the same number to the South, that is, eleven symbolical pictures on each side. These pictures were explained to the candidate for initiation in regular order, and they contained the rules and principles for the Initiate.

>It will be observed that this alphabet has only twentytwo letters, the V and N being duplicated, and that it is arranged in four quinaries, with a quaternary for base and key. The four final letters are two combinations of the duad and the triad, and, read kabbalistically, they form the word AZOTH, by rendering to the shapes of the letters their value in primitive Hebrew, taking N for N, Z as it is in Latin, V for the Hebrew 1 vau, which is pronounced O between two vowels, or letters having the value of vowels, and X for the primitive tau, which had precisely the same figure. The entire Tarot is thus explained in this wonderful medal, which is worthy of Paracelsus, and we hold it at the disposal of the curious. The letters arranged by four times five are summed by the word mZ, analogous to that of mrp, and of INEI, and containing all the mysteries of the Kabbalah.

We have set at the head of each chapter the letter thereto belonging and the Latin words which, according to the best writers, represent its hieroglyphical meaning. For example, at the head of the first chapter will be found:—

Accordingly, the seton was removed on the day above stated. In the month of November she received a very severe blow on the head, which she said would protract her cure one month.

Commenced at a quarter before nine ; fit came on in four minutes, and lasted twenty-four ; sleep very profound in the intervals ; and when the fit went off he did not awake as usual until I made some transverse passes with the hand before his eyes, which instantly aroused him. After the fit he is troubled with violent headache for half an hour, followed by intense itching of the scalp, lasting for about two hours.
## 3: Denis (1838) 460 [0.9868]

>He had no return of the delirium until the evening of thellth, when, at seven, another attack occurred, which lasted two hours, though without violence. The lotion was again used, and also sinapisms to the feet, with decidedly beneficial effect. He continued to have a fit every evening, varying not more than an hour in its time of commencement, and lasting from one to two hours; his nights were sleepless, but during the day he appeared tolerably well.

For three weeks, during which time the animal magnetism was daily repeated, there was no remarkable difference in his case, but in the fourth week the symptoms of the first degree of magnetism presented themselves, and he was brought to the state of sleeping ; and after the daily repetition of animal magnetism during the space of eight weeks, he recovered without any other phenomenon taking place."*

It is beneficial occasionally to move your fingers on the sides, and especially in the region of the spleen. After having continued this exercise for about a quarter of an hour, you should change your mode of operating, according to the state of the patient.

>" Petronille Leclerc, twenty-six years of age, seamstress, entered the Charite to be treated for a spasmodic cerebral affection bordering on epilepsy. She was of an exceedingly nervous temperament, very pale, exhausted by former sufferings, and extremely irritable. She had been seized, after a violent fit of anger, with a turning upwards of the eyeballs, in which position they remained fixed, and resisted all sorts of remedies. The idea occurred to M. Sbire, her medical attendant, of trying the application of magnetism. He made the first trial on the 29th of August last, and subsequently repeated it many times. The most remarkable circumstances of this treatment were noted down, and some of them occurred in our own presence. The following is an account of them : —

>“These wars are encouraged by wicked spirits and the humans who wage them place themselves in direct opposition to God’s will, which is that all human beings should love their brothers and sisters as they love themselves. All religions, or rather all people, worship the same God, regardless of the name they use. Why then would one attempt to exterminate the other simply because they believe in different religions, or because one has not yet reached the same degree of enlightenment as that of the aggressor? People may be excused for not believing in the word of the one who was animated by the Spirit of God and sent by God, especially since they have not seen him and have not witnessed the divine acts. In any event, how can you honestly hope that they would heed his message of peace, when you try to force it upon them with violence? It is true that they need to be enlightened and it is your duty to try to teach them Christ’s doctrine. However, this must be done calmly and peacefully, not through violence. Consider that most of you do not believe in the communications we have with some humans. How could you then expect strangers to believe your claims in regard to this fact, if your acts contradict what you preach?”

>“It is definitely fatalism, if you want to call it that, but it results from the type of life chosen by those individuals in the spirit state, because they wanted to exercise their patience and resignation through a life of disappointment. However, do not believe that destiny is absolute. It is often a consequence for individuals who choose the wrong path, one that does not correspond to their intelligence and abilities. If people try to cross a river without knowing how to swim, they stand a very good chance of drowning, and we can say the same about most events in your life. If people only attempted things that are in harmony with their abilities, they would usually succeed. The cause of their failure is their conceit and ambition, which veer them off their proper path, and make them mistake a desire to satisfy passions for vocation. They fail by their own fault, but instead of blaming themselves, they prefer to blame their ‘star’. For example, an individual who could have been a good craftsperson and honorably earn a living in that capacity prefers to write bad poetry, and ultimately dies of starvation. There would be a place for everyone, if everyone assumed their proper place.”

>When we are in the spirit world, our entire past is revealed and the good or bad that we did is known. Those who have done evil who try to avoid their victims do so in vain. They cannot escape their presence, and it is an atonement and a source of remorse until they atone for the wrongs they have done. Conversely, kindness and goodwill surrounds the spirit of an upright person. Even on Earth, there is no greater torment for a bad person than the presence of his or her victims, whom they try to avoid at all costs. What happens when the illusions of passions dissipate and they understand the wrongs they have done? When they see their secret actions brought to light and their hypocrisy unmasked? When they realize that they cannot hide from those they have wronged? While the soul of the wicked is prey to shame, regret and remorse, the soul of the virtuous enjoys perfect peace. 978. Does the memory of the faults the soul committed when imperfect disturb its happiness even after it reaches purity?

>“Merit is not the word. Although it is better than doing nothing, people who give only after they die are often motivated by selfishness rather than by generosity. They want the honor of doing good without any cost to them. People who impose deprivation upon themselves during their life, reap a double reward, the merit of their sacrifice and the pleasure of witnessing the happiness they have caused. Selfishness is likely to taunt, ‘Whatever you give away will lessen the enjoyment of what you keep for yourself.’ The voice of selfishness is louder than that of charity, and too often it leads a person to keep what they have under the pretext of necessity. You should pity a person who does not know the joy of giving because they deprive themselves of one of the purest and sweetest pleasures in life. In subjecting a person to the trial of wealth, which can be very dangerous for their future, God places the happiness that generosity may secure for them within their reach, even in the present life.” (See no. 814.)

>“When your life is in peril, it is a warning to turn you away from wickedness and leave you better off. When you escape this danger, and while still feeling the emotion stimulated by the danger you encountered, you think according to the degree in which you are influenced by good spirits to mend your ways. If a bad spirit dominates (In using the word bad I am referring to the evil that is still within that spirit), you think that you will escape other dangers in the same manner, and once again you give free rein to your passions. Through the dangers that you encounter, God reminds you of your weakness and the fragility of your existence. If you examine the cause and nature of the peril you have escaped, you will see that in many cases its consequences would have been the atonement of some fault you have committed, or some duty you have neglected. God warns you to reflect upon and correct your faults.” (See nos. 526–532.)

>Our critics counter by inquiring why spirits, who should know everything, are unable to answer simple questions, as dictated by the adage, “He who can do the most can do the least,” and conclude, from this assumed inability, that the phenomena cannot be caused by spirits. If an ignorant or foolish person were to stand before an academic council and ask why it is light out in the middle of the day, would a reply be given? Would it be reasonable to conclude, from the derision or silence with which such a question might be received, that its members were merely imbeciles? It is precisely because they are at a higher level than us that spirits decline to answer idle and foolish questions. This is why they are silent when such questions are asked, or they advise us to focus on more serious subjects.

>“Yes, but we teach you to feel pity for the ungrateful and faithless friends as they are more unhappy than you. Ingratitude comes from selfishness and people who are selfish, eventually, meet hearts as callous as their own. Think of all those who have done more good than you, who are more worthy than you are, and whose kindnesses were paid with ingratitude. Remember that, in his life, Jesus was ridiculed, despised and treated as both a criminal and a fraud; you should not be shocked if you are treated in the same way. The knowledge that you have done good should be your reward in your present life, and do not worry about what people who have benefited from it say. Ingratitude tests your persistence in doing good. It counts in your favor, in the future, and those who have ignored your kindness will be punished. The greater their ingratitude, the more severe the atonement.”

>“You might as well ask why God did not create humans perfect (see no. 119), or why human beings have to experience childhood before arriving at adulthood (see no. 379). The purpose of a trial is not to enlighten God regarding the merit of humankind. God knows exactly what they are worth, but to make human beings fully accountable for their behavior since they have free will. People are free to choose between good and bad, and trials serve to tempt them or prove their resistance, leaving them all the merit for resisting it. Even though God knows well in advance whether they will succeed or not, out of divine justice God cannot reward or punish them other than according to the actions they have committed.” (See no. 258.)

>“God uses imperfect spirits as instruments for testing your faith and perseverance in doing good. As a spirit, you must advance in the knowledge of the infinite. To do this, you suffer trials to attain goodness. Our mission is to lead you to the right path. When you fall prey to bad infuences, it is because you attract lower spirits by your malicious desires. Wicked spirits always come to assist you in carrying out the malevolence you desire to commit. They only help you do wrong when you give in to vile desires. If you are inclined to commit murder, you will have a swarm of spirits around you encouraging you. Conversely, you will also have others who will try to infuence you to do good. This restores balance and allows you to make your own decision.”

>A spirit knows that, in choosing such a road, it will experience a specifc struggle. It knows the nature of the problems that it will encounter, but does not know how they will present themselves. The details of events are the product of circumstances and the force of things; the spirit anticipates only the leading events of a new life and the determining effects on its destiny. If you turn down a road or path full of potholes, you know that you must proceed very carefully because you run a risk of falling. You do not know exactly where you may fall, and if you are prudent, you might not fall at all. If a tile falls on your head while you are walking down the street, you should not think that ‘it was meant to be,’ as is commonly said.”

>“Fatalism only exists based on the choice each spirit makes to undergo a trial. By choosing that trial, you create a sort of destiny for yourself. It is the natural consequence of the situation in which you have chosen to place yourself. This is only with respect to physical trials, because in moral trials and temptations, a spirit always maintains a freedom of choice between good and iniquity and is always able to yield or resist. Good spirits may come to your aid when they see you falter, but cannot influence you to the extent of controlling your will. On the other hand, bad or inferior spirits may trouble or alarm you by exaggerating your physical danger. However, the will of your incarnate spirit maintains its full freedom of choice.”

>“No, there is no such thing as a pact. It is merely sympathy between a vile nature and despicable spirits. For example, imagine you want to irritate your neighbor, but you do not know how. You call out for the assistance of lower order spirits. These spirits, like yourself, want nothing more than to do wrong and in return for the help they give you, they expect you to help them. This does not mean that your neighbor will not be able to fight such a conspiracy with an opposing scheme and the force of his or her own will. If you desire to do evil you call wicked spirits to your assistance by that desire alone, and you are in turn obliged to serve them as they have served you, because they need your help in the evil they seek to do. What you call a pact consists simply in this mutual assistance in doing wrong.”
## 13: Kardec (1857) 363 [0.9944]

>This confusion is completely dependent on specifc features, and the type of death. In cases of violent death, suicide, torture, accident, stroke, injuries, and so on, the spirit is shocked and does not believe that it is dead. It stubbornly maintains the contrary and views the body that it has left as something separate from itself. It recognizes its body and cannot understand how it could be separated from it. It remains among those it has loved, speaks to them, and does not understand why they do not hear it. This illusion lasts until the perispirit has fully separated from the physical body. It is only when this is accomplished that the spirit begins to understand that it no longer is part of the physical world.
## 14: Kardec (1857) 54 [0.9942]

>“Spirits are attracted through empathy for the moral nature of those who contact them. Superior spirits enjoy serious-minded sessions, driven by the love of goodness and the genuine desire to learn and improve. Their presence deters inferior spirits, who, on the contrary, are attracted to free access and may freely act on frivolous individuals or those guided by mere curiosity, and wherever immoral instincts are found. Instead of obtaining good advice or useful information from these spirits, nothing is to be expected from them but trivial diversions, lies, tricks, or hoaxes, as they often assume the names of the most respected and recognized individuals in order to more effortlessly lead people astray.”
## 15: Kardec (1857) 1202 [0.9942]

>“Since human beings are aware of the bad they do, they must also be aware of the good they do as well. It is only by this recognition of their conscience that they can know whether they have done good or bad. By weighing all their actions according to God’s law, especially the law of justice, love and charity, they can decide whether they are good or bad, and can approve or disapprove of those actions accordingly. Therefore, it is not wrong to recognize the fact that they have triumphed over evil and rejoice in having done so, provided that this does not turn into narcissism, because that would be as reprehensible as any of the faults over which they have triumphed.” (See no. 919.)

>Therefore is it evident, — that many are the means to Knowledge, and many are the paths by which we may reach the Goal of the Initiate — wherefore — I would say to each of you; — absurd and ill-judged is it to rule that all shall crowd into one path, because that happens to be the one chosen by one member. There is too much tendency to wish all to follow the Ideal of one, — we are apt to forget that the Ideal of each will lead to the same Truth. We can help each other better, then, by helping each to rise according to his own ideas, rather than, as we often Unwisely do, in advising him to rise to what is best in ourselves only.

>“We have already told you that when spirits are created they are simple and ignorant (see no. 115). God leaves all human beings free to choose their own path; too bad for them if they choose the wrong one, their journey will be longer. If there were no mountains, humans could not grasp the concept of climbing uphill and descending. If there were no rocks, they could not understand the concept that hard bodies exist. Spirits must acquire experience, and to do this properly they must know both good and bad. This is why there is an union of spirit and body.” (See no. 119.)

>“This is what happens: The person falls asleep, and his or her spirit awakens. The spirit of that person is often very far from following the plan that it decided upon while in the body because human life is of little interest to a spirit when its free from matter. This only applies to those members of the human race who have already reached a certain degree of perfection. Others spend their spiritual life very differently. They give free rein to their passions, or remain inactive. It may so happen that a spirit visits someone that their incarnated self suggests to visit before falling asleep, but this is not because it was willed to do so while awake.”

>“If the intelligence of human beings is altered by any cause whatsoever, then they are no longer the masters of their thoughts and are no longer free. Such anomaly is often an atonement for spirits who, in another life, have been vain or arrogant, or have made bad use of their faculties. They may be reborn in the body of a mentally impaired person, as a tyrant may be reborn in the body of a slave, and a callous wealthy man in that of a beggar. Such spirits suffer from this constraint, of which they are fully aware, and this is the action of matter.” (See no. 371 et seq.)

>“Yes, but you saw those incidents when you chose your life as a spirit. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to assume that everything that happens to you was ‘written in the stars’ as people say. An event is often the consequence of something you have done by an act of your own volition. Had you not done that thing, the event would not have taken place. If you burn your finger, it is a trivial inconvenience resulting from your own carelessness and a consequence of matter, not destiny. Only great sorrows, serious events that are capable of influencing your moral state, are predestined by God because they will be useful to your purification and education.”

>Evidence may be received in favor of what has been said, from all well-ascertained truths in science and Nature. Indeed, the conviction that Nature presses upon the mind is irresistible. And evidence of truth has its foundation only in the unchangeable manifestations of Nature; for all truths, being eternal, are established in that which is also eternal, -and are consequently therein manifested. The various scientific and philosophical facts and truths, and all theories that are immovably established, will converge in their respective conclusions and form a united evidence of the truth of the things herein presented. Still, as prior causes are both internal and invisible, although they produce effects visible, these are not always correctly manifested to the senses. For effects are exceedingly changed in their appearance by incidental and surrounding causes. At times, however, effects are truly visible; but only when conditions and circumstances are extremely favorable. Still, effects constantly occur; and these again are the cause of others; so that all things are developed by a concatenation of established causes, each of which follows the specific guidance of an immutable Law. Therefore the innumerable causes that produce corresponding effects, are all referable to some established Principle that is demonstratively known by its results to be unchangeable.
## 2: Davis (1847) 963 [0.9963]

>And while the last attribute unfolded corresponds to all others, its grandeur rises above the highest conceptions of the minds of the world. And notwithstanding the arduous efforts that have been made to conceal this unfolding principle, it is gradually becoming more and more revealed as the interior qualities of mankind are capable of receiving it. This principle comprehends all below its degree of refinement, and contains qualities that will unfold eternally beyond. It is the medium of association between all spiritually-expanded minds. It encompasses and pervades all Nature — the whole world — the Universe. It is the essential germ of more perfect beauties, the highest attribute of the present sphere. It is that which is to be admired and adored above every other thing. It should illuminate the interior constitution of every being, and should give character to every thought; and while it gradually becomes more and more unfolded, it will beget in the mind an affection for an interior knowledge of present and ultimate things. And this is therefore the highest and most perfect principle unfolded from the original Germ consisting of Power; and such is the attribute of immortal TRUTH. And while this is the highest of the present attributes, it is a Germ that will ascend, as all other things progress, to more perfect manifestations in higher spheres.
## 3: Davis (1847) 2008 [0.9962]

>Here, then, is the sensuous evidence that the human form is a form determined by a corresponding creative essence, which is man's organized and immortal soul. Not only in viewing the whole Human World as one Form, is Intelligence discovered as an interior quality and essence, but in every individual structure are all the required qualities to demonstrate an absolute individualization of the interior, creative essence. The whole Human Form or World, is of itself the perfect creation of Nature. This cannot be said of the subordinate kingdoms. Moreover, a single human form is a perfect organization, representative, and reflection, of all the lower compounds in Nature. And thus man is the perfect flower, being progressively developed from all the lower parts of the same great Tree of ceaseless causation. Herein, then, lies the external evidence that man possesses an actuating and organized essence which no other form, possesses. And this will continue to retain its individuality, because it is the perfect form and perfect soul of all the lower degrees of Motion, Life, and Sensation, these being only the elements of the germ which, when perfected, flow into and form one perfect and indestructible Whole, which is the soul or spiritual essence of man.
## 4: Davis (1847) 262 [0.9961]

>δ 32. Each form, therefore, is constantly passing through an endless succession of spheres, in order to associate and correspond with the particles and essences that compose its original nature. And when the mechanic observes all these appearances, which are constantly developing themselves with accompanying principles of life and activity, he has the consolation of knowing that these all operate upon eternal mechanical law. And as developments in Nature become visible, he observes that all principles which are gradually evolved from the internal, are manifest in proportion to the perfection of the substance, form, and instrument, through which each motion and law is made visible. His experience corresponds with truths established in other sciences. —　And the whole confirms the propositions that have been established: That there is a constant and universal motion existing in matter, as an essential property of its nature; that it is continually (and must of necessity be) progressive; and that it also reproduces forms by virtue of the inherent properties of its nature, and that each assumes a degree and species and consequent peculiar association: that these are the production of Matter, and Life and Sensation the production of Motion; that the continuation and perfection of the two principles conjoined, compose Man as an Ultimate; and that man is composed of particles and essences of all things else existing.
## 5: Davis (1847) 189 [0.9957]

>For an understanding of the reasonings which may properly be based upon these classifications, according to the science of correspondences, familiar and physiological illustrations may be presented. These will answer as a chart for universal investigation; for effects are charts by which internal causes may be arrived at. For forms and effects are representatives in a higher degree, of what is existing in a lower or first degree; and the substance of ultimates is a development and —　progression of all beneath its sphere of existence, and is a compound of all substances, refined and rarified to a sphere of ultimate perfection. Consequently it involves all of the lower orders of spheres and existences. Hence it acts on, and subsists upon, substances and particles which compose the original elements of its nature. All beneath an ultimate, or an effect, thus supplies the effect and ultimate; and hence ultimates or effects correspond to, and represent all things in an inferior degree and sphere of perfection. Thus, the human body is a composition of all else:　 —　but to familiarize it with the understanding as corresponding with universals in Nature, an examination of its laws and functions generally, and a classification of them in series and degrees, will be necessary: and this will manifest the doctrines which it is necessary to enforce.
## 6: Davis (1847) 231 [0.9956]

>Every palaetiological science, therefore, adds proof of the great subject under contemplation. If Nature in a particular sense manifests unchangeable productions, having so many and various forms, complications, and correspondences, does not this amount to an absolute demonstration of her inherent and eternal operations in a general process of development? And as the germ of the herb produces body as an effect, and seed as an ultimate; so the Great Essence and Spiritual Fountain of all existence, produces Nature as an Effect, and Spirit as an Ultimate. Is there not internal and external evidence of this, which transcends the mere force of words to express thought? Are there not inward convictions dwelling in the mind, corresponding to its desires for a future and eternal state? Does not the internal constitute the substance of the external? Does not Nature, as an external Effect, point deeply and directly to the Internal, or Fountain of its original production? Is it not a chart whose various lines lead directly, and with almost mathematical certainty, to a future and higher state? Do not the inseparable truths which each science unfolds, constitute paths which terminate at one common Focus?
## 7: Davis (1847) 1440 [0.9955]

>Truth is an element of the Divine Mind, and is developed by the wisdom, uniformity, and harmony, which characterize and render perfect all that is created. It is therefore of divine and celestial origin, and is made manifest to the mind of man by the manifold expression of Nature and the Universe. Being an internal and controlling element, it pervades alike every department of the Univercoelum. It is therefore a necessary and unchangeable Principle, and hence also is ETERNAL. And while all created forms dwell in unity and harmony as arranged in their respective spheres of existence; while all rudimental productions are continually breathed forth and perpetuated by Nature and her laws; and while all the celestial spheres and systems of life, beauty, and perfection, continue to manifest and develop the same order and harmony, Truth will continue to proclaim her divine and eternal omnipotence. When all things that are created are restored to unity and stand in their proper and reciprocal relations, then may man perceive the full manifestation of that Truth which emanates from the celestial Vortex of Love and Wisdom.

>δ 182. We have now ascended in these psychological researches to a consideration of the specific attributes of the soul of man, their relations to each other, and their modes of manifestation from the inner to the outer world. For the question is now fully and irrefutably answered, What is man spiritually? Likewise it is proved, that the soul of man is a decided and established organization, preserving its identity by virtue of the peculiar character of its own constitution, and by the absence of all affinities which could absorb it in anything else. It has been made clear that every soul is differently constructed, this being manifest from the varieties and peculiarities of the human species. Every soul is thus individually organized, and cannot by any possible means become blended or inter-associated with others in such a way as that the soul's individual existence would be annihilated or immersed in the great ocean of moving and intangible substances. The law of association determines the perpetuity of every soul's identity, in both the material and spiritual world: for being in constitution dissimilar to each other and to all things, they cannot become annihilated or disorganized.
## 9: Davis (1847) 1972 [0.9952]

>It is, however, proper to introduce a few more illustrations. The first of these is to be found in the Key, and is established in the subsequent scientific considerations: and that is, "The interior is the real reality, and the productive cause of all external effects." And here this proposition is demonstrated even beyond the possibility of a doubt or refutation. For now we discover that the interior and real cause of the mineral, vegetable, and animal creations, is found only in the rudimental forms or first particles in each specific degree of formation and development. Hence it is impossible to discover the causes of visible effects in as visible a manner as the effects themselves are manifested. But in order to understand the nature and cause of effects, the substance constituting the effect must be analyzed, and its actuating principle discovered. In no other way can there be any absolute knowledge obtained concerning the nature and cause of any of the effects made manifest to the natural senses in the outer world.
## 10: Davis (1847) 139 [0.9950]

>All things in forms and corporeal investiture, which exist upon the face of the earth as displaying life, are correspondents of their inner life or principle — which not only actuates them to thriftiness, but is working, by an undeviating law, the refinement of all subordinate substances: and these visible, corporeal manifestations also stand in analogy with the ultimation of their inner and living principle, which by influx produces rudimental sensation in the organic system, and becomes a part of animal existence. So, tracing the refinement of matter from vegetable to animal existence (the life or soul of plants being perfected to become animal sensation), the refinement and perfection of these two, to become the substance of mind — and the progression of its nature to its second sphere and investiture — you arrive naturally and reasonably at an idea of the future properties, the positively individualized condition and existence of the mind in its first ultimate state of progression.* Admitting this much, you arrive at the condition of existence in which my mind is placed.
## 11: Davis (1847) 301 [0.9950]

>The mind must of necessity have some foundation whereupon it may rest, as it must investigate from a point established. The indications of Nature are of such a character as of themselves to convey a conception of the First Cause of all subordinate existences. Reasoning from the established axiom that there must be a Beginning, or a First Cause, to produce corresponding ones, it follows that either matter has existed from all eternity, or else the essence of an intelligent First Cause. One or the other of these conclusions must of necessity be drawn from the indications which all external substances and forms present. The idea is indisputable that something must have originally existed to produce that which does now exist; that Matter and Motion must have existed independently, or that the Great Cause must have been the Productor of that which does exist. The mind, therefore, is led back from effect to cause, until it conceives of the First Cause, or rather is compelled to admit the existence of such.
## 12: Davis (1847) 2016 [0.9950]

>δ 180. Form, then, is the only external mode by which all essences exist, and is the state which they assume in reference to all material things. The most delicate plant puts forth its tendrils, fibers, and finely-interwoven substances, only by virtue of the essence which develops itself fｒom the inner to the outer world in that form. And the rose, with all its beauty, delicacy, and fragrance, is a perfect representative of the interior essence that developed it. All such forms, however complicated and varied in appearance they may be, manifest only the essential qualities of their own creative soul. The outer, in every instance, is a perfect type, image, and correspondent, of the inner, from which it proceeded. The most delicate animal form is also a representation of its interior, living essence and actuating principle: and the most gigantic animal form is only a higher degree of development and a higher representative of corresponding qualities which are its soul and creator.

>Matter and spirit have heretofore been supposed to constitute two distinct and independent substances, the latter not having any material origin. And minds not being able to comprehend this classification have been driven to extreme and illegitimate conclusions. And this would naturally tend, more than any other classification, to produce a disbelief in the united action of Nature. Instead of making material and spiritual existence totally disconnected, the object and intention of the foregoing has been to prove by acknowledged laws and principles of matter, the production of Intelligence, the perfection of which is Spirit; and to unite the whole operations and mutations of Nature's inherent properties of Motion, Life, and Sensation, from the Great Positive Mind through all intermediate things, to Man; to show that in Man this eternal principle of Spiritual Nature becomes individualized, —and that the First operated through Nature as a Second, to produce Spirit as a Third and grand result.

>When we conceive of an organization, we are at once impressed with the existence of parts and qualities necessary to constitute such properly. The whole is composed of parts, and the parts are necessary to the whole; yet these do not of themselves constitute a perfect organization. For an arch may be composed of an indefinite number of stones, without which the arch could not exist; but suppose the arch to be disorganized, this would not alter the fact that the stones are the parts, and remain in substance unchanged. In order, therefore, to form a perfect organization, it is not only necessary to have every part adapted to the whole, and each part to perform a use and fulfill a purpose, indicating a final cause, but it is necessary that these parts should have life and motion, and enter into mutual relations with each other, and thus form a whole or combined unity, in which a use must be manifest. And the use accomplished is the end of the organization.

>Let the mind, then, infer the interior essence and quality by the external and visible form; but let it not judge entirely by the sheath or external of that which is in the interior, undeveloped. But it should rest upon the inward conviction received both in reference to the external and internal of anything, and thus the judgment would be proper and righteous. And as it is absolutely demonstrated that the cause of all effects exists anterior to them, it now devolves upon the properly-conditioned mind to judge of the interior by the external form. For it is evident that if essence did not exist, form could not: and if form exists, essence must of necessity be the cause of its existence. Essence therefore produces form by an association of its own qualities; and thus all conspicuous forms become unfolded. Thus it is the germ, which, when subjected to suitable conditions, becomes impregnated by its own, latent qualities, and unfolds all the forms and manifestations in the external world.

>And it is necessary that it should be well understood and borne in mind that form is not the creator of life, or of its attributes, but that the form, in every department of Nature, is the exterior mode of every living soul's existence. But in neither of the lower kingdoms have the forms an organized principle of interior life individually, but they have collectively, as constituting one perfect plane of form and creation. The human form has an organized principle individually, because every human organization is a congregation of all subordinate forms and substances in matter, and is likewise an indestructible representation of all. Thus the human body is a Universe, subsisting and existing upon all lower forms of organic life, and is of itself a whole creation, in and by which the labors of Nature, and the ultimate design of the Great Eternal Cause, are typified and absolutely fulfilled. And The human form is of all this a clear and living demonstration.

>Further: the various kingdoms and forms in this rudimental sphere, are all organs for the purpose of transferring, advancing, perfecting, and sublimating all particles in the lower forms of matter, so that they may all conjoin in harmony, and produce Man. Still further: the subordinate kingdoms are forms indispensable for the purpose of communicating a proper energy and quality to each particle of matter, in order to render it suitable to associate and assimilate with the human form. All particles must be modified, recomposed, and brought to a proper degree of perfection, or else the human form could not receive nourishment from, and be sustained by, the lower forms in Nature. This, again, is proof that man is a perfection of matter in all its forms and degrees of sublimation, and that he is the great Flower of the living Germ of this rudimental sphere, and is a Center to and from which flow spontaneously favors, from and to all the lower forms.

>A natural tendency of the mind is to feel a conviction of its own continuance and progression. This amounts to a belief, but not to an absolute knowledge. For no collection of particles or substances of any kind, possesses the power of self-analyzation. Hence all above the power of the mind may be received as a desirable conviction, yet not a palpable reality. To me this reality is made perfect. My perceptions and general impressions are from the ultimate or perfection of all material substances. The scope of these perceptions and impressions, comprehends the substance of the second Sphere in a particular sense, even as it comprehends all in a general sense. And as the result of present things is the substance of the second Sphere, I in this Sphere have the perception of the things pre-impressed upon the mind to investigate. Things appear real to me which are beyond the reach of the natural organization, which knows of nothing except what exists in matter and form.

>Human conceptions of order are founded upon the supposed reality of apparent confusion; and when apparent confusion and irregularities are observed, the mind instantly conceives of their opposite order. Hence if confusion were not apparent, the word order would be without meaning. But where order universally exists, and confusion is temporarily and minutely apparent to the mind, there the general conception of order, would be evidently correct; as it would be derived from contrasting the order of a general, with the disorder of an incidental character. Therefore if order is apparently universal, this at once establishes the doctrine of uniformity; and all particular and apparent confusion must be referred to incidental and local causes. But the great Whole being correctly comprehended, presents a system of undisturbed order and harmony!

>Keeping in mind, then, the uniform developments from the inner to the outer world, a knowledge is received concerning the corresponding development of the animal world. For as by understanding one particle of matter, with all its properties, tendencies, and capabilities, a corresponding knowledge is obtained concerning the structure of the whole Universe — so by understanding the mode of the existence of Life, an understanding is at once established concerning the higher degrees and similar modes of existence, as determined by their Soul or essence. And as by knowing the measurement of one inch, a rule is obtained by which may be measured the length and breadth of all material existence — so it is equally plain that if the existence of Life and Sensation is understood, the same laws and principles which govern these will introduce the mind into higher degrees and planes of corresponding exterior development.
