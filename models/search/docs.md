>‘The consciousness then seems to pass through the symbol to realms beyond it: probably visions and pictures from other planes come on to the hypersensitive brain centres. The sensation is as if looking at a series of moving pictures, and although there are beings with whom one can converse and animals one can dominate, there is no more solidity than in a cinema film. In time, however, the sensitivity of the brain increases, and one gains the power of actually going to the scenes of the visions and seeing them as three dimensional — indeed, one actually becomes capable of doing things in the vision and producing effects upon it. This is what is technically known as ‘Travelling in the Spirit Vision’ and whether it is more than an extension of the power of seeing the moving pictures on the Sphere of Sensation (the akashic envelope) is difficult to determine. The stages of Travelling in the Spirit Vision are as follows: —

>Whether it is more than an extension of the power of perceiving the pictures on the Sphere of Sensation or Akashic envelope is very difficult to determine. The sensation, however, to me personally is first to become, as it were, dimly conscious of a figure walking among the scenes of the new country — or the Astral Plane — gradually to become conscious that it is my own figure I am looking at — gradually, as it were, to be able to look through the eyes — and feel with the sensations of this doppel ganger. Further to be able consciously to direct its motions, to control it, to inhabit it, and in this body to be able to visit the scenes and persons I had previously only looked at, as it were, through a telescope.

>‘It is as though consciousness was extruded from one’s own body and taken over a body either created for the purpose or invoked out of the astral sphere. It seems probably that as the Sphere of Sensation reflects everything on the physical plane it contains a reflection of the material body of the percipient. If this is so it would follow that the body could be made to travel within the Sphere of Sensation and visit all things reflected therein.

>When a man has lived well the astral body evaporates like a pure incense ascending towards the upper regions ; but should he have lived in sin, his astral body, which holds him prisoner, still seeks the objects of its passions, and wishes to return to life. It torments the dreams of young girls, bathes in the steam of spilt blood, and floats about the places where the pleasures of its life elapsed ; it still watches over treasures which it possessed and buried; it expends itself in painful efforts to make fresh material organs and so live again. But the stars draw it up and absorb it ; its feels its intelligence weaken, its memory gradually vanishes, all its being dissolves. . . . Its former vices rise up before it, assume monstrous shapes, and pursue it ; they attack and devour it. ... The unfortunate creature thus successively loses all the members which have ministered to his iniquities ; then he dies a second time and for ever, because he loses his personality and his memory. Souls which are destined to live, but are not yet completely purified, remain captive for a longer or shorter period in the astral body, wherein they are burned by the odic light, which seeks to absorb and dissolve them. It is in order to escape from this body that suffering souls sometimes enter the bodies of the living and therein dwell in that state which Kabbalists term embryonic. Now, it is these aerial bodies which are evoked by necromancy. We enter into connection with larvae, with dead or perishing substances, by this operation. The beings in question, for the most part, cannot speak except by the tingling of our ears produced by the nervous shock to which I have referred, and commonly they can only reason by reflecting our thoughts and our reveries. To behold these strange forms, we must put ourselves in abnormal condition akin to sleep or death, in other words, we must magnetise ourselves and enter into a kind of lucid and waking somnambulism. Then necromancy has real results, and then the evocations of magic can produce actual visions. We have said that in the great magical agent, which is the astral light, there are preserved all impressions of things, all images formed either by rays or reflections ; in this same light our visions come to us, and it is this which intoxicates the insane, and leads away their dormant judgment in pursuit of the most bizarre phantoms. To insure vision without illusion in this light, a powerful will must be with us to isolate reflections and attract rays only. To dream awake is to see in the astral light, and the orgies of the Sabbath, described by so many sorcerers in their criminal trials, came to them solely in this manner. The preparations and the substances used to obtain this result were often horrible, as we shall see in the Ritual, but the result itself was never doubtful. They beheld, they heard, they handled the most abominable, most fantastic, most impossible things. We shall return to this subject in our fifteenth chapter ; at the present moment we are concerned only with the evocations of the dead.
## 5: Levi (1860) 511 [3]

>Let us pass to another maniac who was called Theophrastus Aureolus Bombast and was known in the World of Magic under the famous name of Paracelsus. There is no need to recapitulate what has been said concerning this master in our _Doctrine and Ritual of Transcendental Magic_, but something may be added on the occult medicine restored by Paracelsus. This truly universal medicine is based upon a spacious theory of light, called by adepts fluid or potable gold. Light, that creative agent, the vibrations of which are the movement and life of all things; light, latent in the universal ether, radiating about absorbing centres, which, being saturated thereby, project movement and life in their turn, so forming creative currents; light, astralised in the stars, animalised in animals, humanised in human beings; light, which vegetates in plants, glistens in metals, produces all forms of Nature and equilibrates all by the laws of universal sympathy—this is that light which exhibits the phenomena of magnetism, divined by Paracelsus, which tinctures the blood, being released from the air as it is inhaled and discharged by the hermetic bellows of the lungs. The blood then becomes a true elixir of life, wherein ruby and magnetic globules of vital light float in a slightly gilded fluid. These globules are actual seeds, ready to assume all forms of that world whereof the human body is an abridgment. They can become rarefied and coagulated, so renewing the humours which circulate in the nerves and in the flesh encompassing the bones. They radiate outside, or rather, in rarefying, they are drawn by the currents of light and circulate in the astral body—that interior and luminous body which is dilated by the imagination of ecstatics, so that their blood sometimes colours objects at a distance when these have been penetrated and identified with the astral body. In a special work on occult medicine that which is stated here will be proved, however strange and paradoxical it may seem at first sight to men of science. Such were the bases of medicine as put forward by Paracelsus; he cured by sympathy of light; he administered medicaments not to the outward material body, which is entirely passive, which can be rent and cut up without feeling anything when the astral body has withdrawn, but to the inward medium, to that vehicle which is the source of sensations. The quintessence of these he renewed by sympathetic quintessences. For example, he healed wounds by applying powerful reactives to the spilt blood, thus sending back its physical soul and purified sap to the body. To cure a diseased limb he made a limb of wax and, by will-power, transferred thereto the magnetism of the diseased limb. Then he treated the wax with vitriol, iron and fire, thus reacting by imagination and magnetic correspondence on the sick person himself, to whom the limb of wax had become an appendix and supplement. Paracelsus knew the mysteries of blood; he knew why the priests of Baal made incisions with knives in their flesh, and then brought down fire from heaven; he knew why orientals poured out their blood before a woman to inspire her with physical love; he knew how spilt blood cries for vengeance or mercy and fills the air with angels or demons. Blood is the instrument of dreams and multiplies images in the brain during sleep, because it is full of the Astral Light. Its globules are bisexual, magnetised and metalled, sympathetic and repelling. All forms and images in the world can be evoked from the physical soul or blood.

>Theo. In many ways. The causes of such manifestations are by no means so simple as the Spiritualists would like to believe. Foremost of all, the deus ex machina of the so-called "materializations" is usually the astral body or "double" of the medium or of some one present. This astral body is also the producer or operating force in the manifestations of slate-writing, "Davenport"-like manifestations, and so on.
## 7: King (1987) 84 [2]

>Then, maintaining your abstraction from your surroundings, and still concentrating upon the symbol and its correlated ideas, you are to seek a perception of a scene, panorama, or view of a place. This may also be brought on by a sense of tearing open, as a curtain is drawn aside and seeing the ‘within’ of the symbol before you. As the scene dawns upon you, particularise the details, and seek around for objects, and then for beings, entities and persons — attract their attention, call mentally to them by suitable titles and courtesies, and by proper and appropriate signs and symbols, such as the signs of the Grades, Pentagrams, etc. Test them by divine and angelic names, observing their attitude and responses thereto. Thus losing sight of the symbol, you see its inwardness, perceive things as in a mirror by Reflection. In this form of Descrying, note, that you see objects reversed, as to right and left, for which suitable allowance must be made. You project, in this process, part of your own nerve and spirit force upon the symbol, and by this you attract and attach to it more akashic force from the environment, hence the results obtained. If, instead of this Simple Spirit Vision, a ray of yourself is sent and actually goes to a place (astral projection) FLYING ROLL NO. XI

>Astral Projection, although from one point of thought a development of Clairvoyance, yet is from another distinct: in Astral Projection, the Adept emits from his Ego a perceptible ray of his identity, and by cultured and instructed Will, sends it to travel to the place desired, focusses it there, sees there — directly and not by reflection — perceives its bodily home, and re-enters it.
## 9: King (1987) 108 [2]

>If, then, everything in the Cosmos is somehow reflected or pictured on each man’s own sphere of sensation, or Akashic. envelope, it follows that if he could but be conscious of the pictures so reflected or imprinted he would at once be possessed of all actual or potential knowledge of everything in the Cosmos, and further assuming that time itself is merely an illusion, and that the reality of things is, as it were, one vast picture along which we travel seeing point after point in succession and producing the idea of lapse of time, then it further follows that the full and complete knowledge of all that is reflected in our sphere of sensation includes all knowledge past, present and future.
## 10: King (1987) 109 [2]

>The reason, then, why we have not such knowledge consciously to ourselves must be from the obtuseness of the Sensorium, the actual physical brain, which cannot perceive the images on the sphere of sensation. If, then, all knowledge lies ■within each man’s own sphere, it is by looking within, or intuition, that such knowledge is made available.
## 11: King (1987) 110 [2]

>Know thyself and thou wilt know everything. But seeing that the brain and sensorium are physical, it is necessary at first to use physical means to produce the sensitiveness necessary to consciously perceive the images on the Sphere of Sensation. And the readiest and safest means is the use of a symbol. This is familiar in everyday life, but so much so as to escape notice.
## 12: King (1987) 123 [2]

>It seems, however, almost more probable that as the Sphere of Sensation reflects everything that is in the material Universe so it must needs contain a reflection also of the material body of the percipient and if this be so it is not hard to suppose that such reflection can be made to travel about within the Sphere of Sensation and visit all things therein reflected with as much ease (or more) as the will of the man can make his physical body travel to material places on the earth.
## 13: King (1987) 195 [2]

>Secondly, as to the extension of our powers of perception beyond the plane of matter into the super-sensuous world, you must remember that the Theosophical view is the correct one and that our Thinking Personalities are incarnated into these material bodies and are acting therefore under the consequent disadvantages. It is because the mind is immersed in matter that its powers are so limited, and we can readily understand that a mind freed from constraints of the body would enjoy vastly enlarged powers. Thus, although our senses are the means by which we perceive; yet at the same time they necessarily limit the extent of our perception. It is therefore our material bodily organs which circumscribe as well as bestow. All of our five senses are capable of enlargement and development. It is however the sense of sight which we most commonly seek thus to develop. Having intellectually learned the laws which relate to sight and colour we are encouraged to practice Clairvoyance and to seek to see beyond material things into the plane most adjacent to us — the Astral, and then we seek to travel in the Spirit Vision through the confusions and the uncertainties of the Astral into the planes beyond.

>The Consciousness after death depends on the state of the Astral body here. In some cases it is weak and weary from its earthly pilgrimage here and requires a long sleep — in other cases it has periods of probation to undergo — or of purgation — but there are cases where the Astral enters at once on a career of help to those on earth — and to those also on its own astral plane.

>Those of the grade of our beloved Frater ShMSh and myself are associated with many helpers on the astral — some of whom worked with us in life — and after death with scarcely a break continued to work on the astral plane — their relation to us being only slightly changed.

>(c) The “Sea of Fire” is, then, the Super‐Astral (i.e., Noumenal) Light, the first radiation from the Root Mûlaprakriti, Undifferentiated Cosmic Substance, which becomes Astral Matter. It is also called the “Fiery Serpent,” as above described. If the student bears in mind that there is but One Universal Element, which is infinite, unborn, and undying and that all the rest—as in the world of phenomena—are but so many various differentiated aspects and transformations (correlations, they are now called) of that One, from macrocosmical down to microcosmical effects, from super‐human down to human and sub‐human beings, the totality, in short, of objective existence—then the first and chief difficulty will disappear and Occult Cosmology may be mastered. Thus in the Egyptian also as in the Indian Theogony there was a Concealed Deity, the ONE, and a creative, androgynous god; Shoo being the god of creation, and Osiris in his original primary form, the god “whose name is unknown.”

>“Thought is matter”: not of course, however, in the sense of the German Materialist Moleschott, who assures us that “thought is the movement of matter”—a statement of almost unparalleled absurdity. Mental states and bodily states are utterly contrasted as such. But that does not affect the position that every thought, in addition to its physical accompaniment (brain‐change), exhibits an objective—though to us supersensuously objective—aspect on the astral plane.

>“Lead the life necessary for the acquisition of such knowledge and powers, and Wisdom will come to you naturally. Whenever you are able to attune your consciousness to any of the seven chords of ‘Universal Consciousness,’ those chords that run along the sounding‐board of Kosmos, vibrating from one Eternity to another; when you have studied thoroughly the ‘Music of the Spheres,’ then only will you become quite free to share your knowledge with those with whom it is safe to do so. Meanwhile, be prudent. Do not give out the great Truths that are the inheritance of the future Races, to our present generation. Do not attempt to unveil the secret of Being and Non‐Being to those unable to see the hidden meaning of Apollo’s Heptachord, the lyre of the radiant god, in each of the seven strings of which dwelleth the Spirit, Soul and Astral Body of the Kosmos, whose shell only has now fallen into the hands of modern Science.... Be prudent, we say, prudent and wise, and above all take care what those who learn from you believe in; lest by deceiving themselves they deceive others, ... for such is the fate of every truth with which men are, as yet, unfamiliar.... Let rather the Planetary Chains and other super‐ and sub‐cosmic mysteries remain a dreamland for those who can neither see, nor yet believe that others can.”

>Let it be remembered that the Fire, Water, and Air of Occultism, or the “Elements of Primary Creation” so‐called, are not the compound elements they are on earth, but noumenal homogeneous Elements—the Spirits of the former. Then follow the Septenary Groups or Hosts. Placed on parallel lines with the atoms in a diagram, the natures of these Beings would be seen to correspond, in their downward scale of progression, to composite elements in a mathematically identical manner as to analogy. This refers, of course, only to diagrams made by Occultists; for were the scale of Angelic Beings to be placed on parallel lines with the scale of the chemical atoms of Science—from the hypothetical Helium down to Uranium—they would of course be found to differ. For the latter have, as correspondents on the Astral Plane, only the four lowest orders—the three higher principles in the atom, or rather molecule, or chemical element, being perceptible to the initiated Dangma’s eye alone. But then, if Chemistry desired to find itself on the right path, it would have to correct its tabular arrangement by that of the Occultists—which it might refuse to do. In Esoteric Philosophy, every physical particle corresponds to, and depends on, its higher noumenon—the Being to whose essence it belongs; and, above as below, the Spiritual evolves from the Divine, the Psycho‐mental from the Spiritual—tainted from its lower plane by the Astral—the whole animate and (seemingly) inanimate Nature evolving on parallel lines, and drawing its attributes from above as well as below.

But if the conquered in accordance with the better Man, or Manas, tries to inspirations of Neshamah. escape the fatal attraction, and turns its aspirations to Âtmâ (Neshamah), then Buddhi (Ruach) conquers, and carries Manas with it to the realm of eternal Spirit.

>The Third Round developed the third Principle—WATER; while the Fourth transformed the gaseous fluids and plastic form of our Globe into the hard, crusted, grossly material sphere we are living on. Bhûmi has reached her fourth Principle. To this it may be objected that the law of analogy, so much insisted upon, is broken. Not at all. Earth will reach her true ultimate form—her body shell—inversely in this to man, only toward the end of the Manvantara, after the Seventh Round. Eugenius Philalethes was right when he assured his readers, “on his word of honour,” that no one had yet seen the “Earth,” i.e., Matter in its essential form. Our Globe is, so far, in its Kâmarûpic state—the Astral Body of Desires of Ahamkâra, dark Egotism, the progeny of Mahat, on the lower plane.

>As already stated, Aditi‐Vâch is the female Logos, or Verbum, the Word; and Sephira in the Kabalah is the same. These feminine Logoi are all correlations, in their noumenal aspect, of Light, and Sound, and Æther, showing how well‐informed were the Ancients both in Physical Science, as now known to the moderns, and also as to the birth of that Science in the Spiritual and Astral spheres.

>On the question of the “Seven Governors”—as Hermes calls the “Seven Builders,” the Spirits which guide the operations of Nature, the animated atoms of which are the shadows, in their own world, of their Primaries in the Astral Realms—this work will, of course, have every Materialist against it, as well as the men of Science. But this opposition can, at most, be only temporary. People have laughed at everything unusual, and have scouted every unpopular idea at first, and have then ended by accepting it. Materialism and Scepticism are evils that must remain in the world so long as man has not quitted his present gross form to don the one he had during the First and Second Races of this Round. Unless Scepticism and our present natural ignorance are equilibrated by Intuition and a natural Spirituality, every being afflicted with such feelings will see in himself nothing better than a bundle of flesh, bones, and muscles, with an empty garret inside, which serves the purpose of storing his sensations and feelings. Sir Humphrey Davy was a great Scientist, as deeply versed in Physics as any theorist of our day, yet he loathed Materialism. He says:
## 26: Blavatsky (1888) 1960 [1]

>Yes; “our destiny is written in the stars”! Only, the closer the union between the mortal reflection Man and his celestial Prototype, the less dangerous the external conditions and subsequent reïncarnations—which neither Buddhas nor Christs can escape. This is not superstition, least of all is it fatalism. The latter implies a blind course of some still blinder power, but man is a free agent during his stay on earth. He cannot escape his ruling Destiny, but he has the choice of two paths that lead him in that direction, and he can reach the goal of misery—if such is decreed to him—either in the snowy white robes of the martyr, or in the soiled garments of a volunteer in the iniquitous course; for there are external and internal conditions which affect the determination of our will upon our actions, and it is in our power to follow either of the two. Those who believe in Karma have to believe in Destiny, which, from birth to death, every man weaves thread by thread round himself, as a spider his web; and this Destiny is guided either by the heavenly voice of the invisible Prototype outside of us, or by our more intimate astral, or inner man, who is but too often the evil genius of the embodied entity called man. Both these lead on the outward man, but one of them must prevail; and from the very beginning of the invisible affray the stern and implacable Law of Compensation steps in and takes its course, faithfully following the fluctuations of the fight. When the last strand is woven, and man is seemingly enwrapped in the network of his own doing, then he finds himself completely under the empire of this self‐made Destiny. It then either fixes him like the inert shell against the immovable rock, or carries him away like a feather in a whirlwind raised by his own actions, and this is—KARMA.
## 27: Blavatsky (1888) 1973 [1]

>Therefore, if any one is helpless before these immutable laws, it is not ourselves, the artificers of our destinies, but rather those Angels, the guardians of Harmony. Karma‐Nemesis is no more than the spiritual dynamical effect of causes produced, and forces awakened into activity, by our own actions. It is a law of Occult dynamics that “a given amount of energy expended on the spiritual or astral plane is productive of far greater results than the same amount expended on the physical objective plane of existence.”

>1156 Aanroo is in the domain of Osiris, a field divided into fourteen sections, “surrounded with an iron enclosure, within which grows the corn of life seven cubits high,” the Kâma Loka of the Egyptians. Those only of the dead, who know the names of the janitors of the “seven halls,” will be admitted into Amenti for ever; i.e., those who have passed through the Seven Races of each Round—otherwise they will rest in the lower fields; and it represents also the seven successive Devachans, or Lokas. In Amenti one becomes pure spirit for the eternity (xxx. 4); while in Aanroo the “soul of the spirit,” or the Defunct, is devoured each time by Uræus—the Serpent, Son of the Earth (in another sense the primordial vital principles in the Sun), i.e., the Astral Body of the deceased or the “Elementary” fades out and disappears in the “Son of the Earth,” limited time. The soul quits the fields of Aanroo and goes on earth under any shape it likes to assume. (See chapter xcix., Book of the Dead.)

>Theo. It may be so in your modern Christian and even Scientific catechism; it is not so for unbiassed minds. The Egyptians revered the "One-Only-One," as Nout; and it is from this word that Anaxagoras got his denomination Nous, or as he calls it, Nous autokrates, "the Mind or Spirit Self-potent," the archetes kinedeos, the leading motor, or primum-mobile of all. With him the Nous was God, and the logos was man, his emanation. The Nous is the spirit (whether in Kosmos or in man), and the logos, whether Universe or astral body, the emanation of the former, the physical body being merely the animal. Our external powers perceive phenomena; our Nous alone is able to recognise their noumena. It is the logos alone, or the noumenon, that survives, because it is immortal in its very nature and essence, and the logos in man is the Eternal Ego, that which reincarnates and lasts for ever. But how can the evanescent or external shadow, the temporary clothing of that divine Emanation which returns to the source whence it proceeded, be that which is raised in incorruptibility?
## 30: Blavatsky (1889) 284 [1]

>Theo. When the man dies, his lower three principles leave him for ever; i. e., body, life, and the vehicle of the latter, the astral body or the double of the living man. And then, his four principles — the central or middle principle, the animal soul or Kama-rupa, with what it has assimilated from the lower Manas, and the higher triad find themselves in Kama-loka. The latter is an astral locality, the limbus of scholastic theology, the Hades of the ancients, and, strictly speaking, a locality only in a relative sense. It has neither a definite area nor boundary, but exists within subjective space; i. e., is beyond our sensuous perceptions. Still it exists, and it is there that the astral eidolons of all the beings that have lived, animals included, await their second death. For the animals it comes with the disintegration and the entire fading out of their astral particles to the last. For the human eidolon it begins when the Atma-Buddhi-Manasic triad is said to "separate" itself from its lower principles, or the reflection of the ex-personality, by falling into the Devachanic state.

>In vibratory manner pronounced Daleth. Then, in spirit, saw a greenish blue distant landscape, suggestive of mediaeval tapestry. Effort to ascend was then made; rising on the planes; seemed to pass up through clouds and then appeared a pale green landscape and in its midst a Gothic Temple of ghostly outlines marked with light. Approached it and found the temple gained in definiteness and was concrete, and seemed a solid structure. Giving the signs of the Netzach Grade (because of Venus) was able to enter; giving also Portal signs and 5 0 = 6° signs in thought form. Opposite the entrance perceived a Cross with three bars and a dove upon it; and beside this, were steps leading downwards into the dark, by a dark passage. Here was met a beautiful green dragon, who moved aside, meaning no harm, and the spirit vision passed on. Turning a corner and still passing on in the dark emerged from the darkness on to a marble terrace brilliantly white, and a garden beyond, with flowers, whose foliage was of a delicate green kind and the leaves seemed to have a white velvety surface beneath. Here, there appeared a woman of heroic proportions, clothed in green with a jewelled girdle, a crown of stars on her head, in her hand a sceptre of gold, having at one apex a lustrously white closed lotus flower; in her left hand an orb bearing a cross.*

>We pass through life affecting others, and being affected by others through these akashic envelopes that closely surround us — so that when we close the eyes of the body and senses upon the material world, we first apprehend by interior vision the essences of our own and contiguous natures. This perception of our own environment is a source of error to the beginner in Clairvoyance; for he believes himself to have gone away and to see elsewhere, and may be but among the confused images of his own aura.

>In using Symbols it is necessary to avoid Self hypnotisation, for this occurrence would dispose you to mediumship, and to be the playground of forces you must control, and not permit to control you. For this reason, partly, it is well not to have the Symbol too small. It is of advantage to pursue these researches with the aid of the presence before you of the four Magical Implements, and even to hold the one suitable to the investigation. If you enter upon the Spirit Vision without a Symbol you proceed by a mental symbol, imagined in the Astral Light : this is not a wise proceeding for learners because it opens the door to other Astral effects; you create a vortex, into which other astral influences are drawn and hence confusion and mischief may result.

>In all these cases ideas and visions are produced in the brain by the symbol, and if the above theory be accepted it follows that the effect of the symbol is to render one portion of the physical brain more sensitive, or it may be more translucent, so that the images lying within the corresponding region of the Sphere of Sensation may be dimly perceived (such sensitiveness of brain may be produced in other ways, such as by Hypnotism or self-induced Trance, by Obsession, Disease, etc. — but the method by symbol seems to remain the surest and the best).

>At first it seems as though everything thus perceived were just the product of one’s own imagination — i.e. that one simply took scraps of memory, scraps of other men’s ideas gleaned from books, pictures, etc. and built them up at will into a composite picture. But a little further experience generally convinces one that the new country one has become conscious of has its inviolable natural laws just as the physical world has : that one cannot make or unmake at will, that the same causes produce the same results, that one is in fact merely a spectator and in no sense a creator. The conviction then dawns on one that one is actually perceiving a new and much extended range of phenomena; that, in fact, which is known as the Astral World or Astral Plane.

It will lead him to compare the lower with the higher and the higher with the lower. Just the sort of mind to find out for itself that ‘as above so below’ is a great truth in nature.

>Now I will put to you the question, where was the mystic body of our Founder, Christian Rosenkreutz discovered? In Tiphereth. And what is Tiphereth? The centre. That is to say it is in the centre of the middle Sphere and when that middle Sphere is projected what does it represent? The Polar Axis. Representing then the Polar Axis it will be in a sense invisible from the outside. Therefore the outermost form of the whole projection will be spherical. Now that would imply that Tiphereth corresponds to the heart and Tiphereth represents the place where the Chief Adept is found and it is the Polar Axis, and the influence which is surrounding this physical body of the man is a Sphere like that of the Universe. This Sphere then surrounds the body. Thus it will be the Assiah Plane of the Man, the Malkuth containing the reflection of the other Ten Sephiroth. Now this Sphere is what we of the Rosier ucian Order, call the magical mirror of the Universe, or the Sphere of sensation of the Microcosm. It is the Aura of the man. Now you will understand that as the Chief Adept is placed in Tiphereth you may expect to find the most vital portion of the body about the heart. The heart will therefore represent the King of the physical body. All this is, of course, much better explained in the lecture on the Microcosm which you will get later on.

# Astral Light

## 1: Levi (1856) 93 [8]

>Let us now state the manner in which visions operate. All forms correspond to ideas, and there is no idea which has not its proper and peculiar form. The primordial light, which is the vehicle of all ideas, is the mother of all forms, and transmits them from emanation to emanation, merely Diminished or modified according to the density of the media. Secondary forms are reflections which return to the font of the emanated light. The forms of objects, being a modification of light, remain in the light where the reflection consigns them. Hence the astral light, or terrestrial fluid, which we call the great magnetic agent, is saturated with all kinds of images or reflections. Now, our soul can evoke these, and refer them to its diaphane, as the kabbalists term it. Such images are always present to us, and are only effaced by the more powerful impressions of reality during waking hours, or by preoccupation of the mind, which makes our imagination inattentive to the fluidic panorama of the astral light. When we sleep, this spectacle presents itself spontaneously before us, and in this way dreams are produced dreams vague and incoherent if some governing will do not remain active during the sleep, giving, even unconsciously to our intelligence, a direction to the dream, which then transforms into vision. Animal magnetism is nothing else but an artificial sleep produced by the voluntary or enforced union of two wills, one of which is awake while the other slumbers that is, one of which directs the other in the choice of reflections for the transformation of dreams into visions, and the attainment of truth by means of images. Thus, somnambulists do not actually travel to the place where they are sent by the magnetiser ; they evoke its images in the astral light, and can behold nothing which does not exist in that light. The astral light has a direct action on the nerves, which are its conductors in the animal economy, transmitting it to the brain, whence also, in the state of somnambulism, it is possible to see by means of the nerves, without being dependent on radiant light, the astral fluid being a latent light, in the same way that physics recognise the existence of a latent caloric.
## 2: Levi (1856) 105 [4]

>Man is the microcosm or little world, ant centres the doctrine of analogies, whatsoever is in th is reproduced in the small. Hence we have of fluidic attraction and projection the brain, the heart or epigastric region, and the genital organ. Each of these instruments is double in other words, we find the suggestion of the triad therein. Each attracts on one side and repels on another. It is by means of these apparatuses that we place ourselves in communication with the universal fluid transmitted into us by the nervous system. These three centres are, moreover, the seat of the threefold magnetic operation, as we shall explain elsewhere. When the magus has attained lucidity, whether through the mediation of a pythoness, or by his own development, he communicates and directs at will the magnetic vibrations in the whole mass of the astral light, the currents of which he divines by means of the magic rod, which is a perfected divining rod. By the aid of these vibrations he influences the nervous system of persons surrendered to his action, accelerates or suspends the currents of life, soothes or tortures, heals or hurts ; in fine, slays or brings to life. . . . Here, however, we pause in presence of the smile of incredulity. Let us permit it to enjoy the cheap triumph of denying what it does not know. We shall demonstrate later on that death is always preceded by a lethargic sleep, and only takes place gradually ; that resurrection is possible in certain cases ; that lethargy is a real, but uncompleted, death ; and that the final paroxysm is in many cases subsequent to inhumation. This, however, is not the subject of the present chapter. We now affirm that a lucid will can act upon the mass of the astral light, and, in concurrence with other wills, which it absorbs and draws along, can determine great and irresistible currents. We say also that the astral light condenses or rarefies in proportion as currents accumulate, more or less, at certain centres. When it is deficient in the energy required for the support of life, diseases accompanied by sudden decomposition follow, of the kind which baffle physicians. There is no other cause, by example, in the case of cholera-morbus, and the swarms of animalcule observed or supposed by some specialists may be the effect rather than the cause. Cholera should therefore be treated by insufflation, did not the operator thereby run the chance of an exchange with the patient, which would be very formidable for himself. Every intelligent effort of will is a projection of the human fluid or light, and here it is needful to distinguish the human from the astral light, and animal from universal magnetism. In making use of the word fluid, we employ an accepted expression, and would make ourselves understood in this manner, but we are far from deciding that the latent light is a fluid. Everything prompts us, on the contrary, to prefer the system of vibrations in the explanation of this phenomenal subject. However it may be, the light in question, being the instrument of life, cleaves naturally to all living centres, attaches itself to the nucleus of planets, even as to the heart of man and by the heart we understand magically the great sympathetic identifying itself with the individual life of the being which it animates, and it is by this quality of sympathetic assimilation that it distributes itself without confusion. Hence it is terrestrial in its affinity with the sphere of the earth, and human exclusively in its affinity with men.

>The phenomena which have quite recently perturbed America and Europe, as regards table-turning and fluidic manifestations, are simply magnetic currents at the beginning of their formation, appeals on the part of nature inviting us, for the good of humanity, to re-establish the great sympathetic and religious chains. As a fact, stagnation in the astral light would mean death to the human race, and torpor in this secret agent has already been manifested by alarming symptoms of decomposition and death. For example, cholera-morbus, the potato disease, and the blight of the grape, are traceable solely to this cause, as the two young shepherds of la Salette saw darkly and symbolically in their dream. The unlooked-for credit which awaited their narrative, and the vast concourse of pilgrims attracted by a statement so singular and at the same time so vague as that of these two children without instruction and almost without morality, are proofs of the magnetic reality of the fact, and the fluidic tendency of the earth itself to operate the cure of its inhabitants. Superstitions are instinctive, and all that is instinctive is founded in the very nature of things, to which fact the sceptics of all times have given insufficient attention. We attribute, then, all the strange phenomena of table-turning to the universal magnetic agent in search of a chain of enthusiasms with a view to the formation of fresh currents. The force of itself is blind, but it can be directed by the will of man, and is influenced by prevailing opinions. This universal fluid if we decide to regard it as a fluid being the common medium of all nervous organisms, and the vehicle of all sensitive vibrations, establishes an actual physical solidarity between impressionable persons, and transmits from one to another the impressions of imagination and of thought. The movement of the inert object, determined by the undulations of the universal agent, obeys the ruling impression, and reproduces in its revelations at one time all the lucidity of the most wonderful visions, and at another all the eccentricity and falsehood of the most vague and incoherent dreams. The blows resounding on furniture, the clattering of dishes, the self -playing of musical instruments, are illusions produced by the same cause. The miracles of the convulsionaries of Saint Medard were of the same order, and seemed frequently to suspend the laws of nature. On the one hand, exaggeration produced by fascination, which is the special quality of intoxication occasioned by congestions of the astral light; on the other, actual oscillations or movements impressed upon inert matter by the subtle and universal agent of motion and life. Such is the sole foundation of these occurrences which look so marvellous, as we may easily demonstrate at will by reproducing, in accordance with rules laid down in the Ritual, the most astounding of these phenomena, establishing, as can be done quite simply, the absence of trickery, hallucination, or error.

Beginning with the pure spiritual plane, it becomes grosser as it descends, until it becomes Mâyâ, or the tempting and deceitful Serpent on our plane.

>Therefore, the elements of our planet cannot be taken as a standard for comparison with the elements in other worlds. In fact each world has its Fohat, which is omnipresent in its own sphere of action. But there are as many Fohats as there are worlds, each varying in power and degree of manifestation. The individual Fohats make one universal, collective Fohat—the aspect‐entity of the one absolute Non‐Entity, which is absolute Be‐ness, Sat. “Millions and billions of worlds are produced at every Manvantara”—it is said. Therefore there must be many Fohats, whom we consider as conscious and intelligent Forces. This, no doubt, to the disgust of scientific minds. Nevertheless the Occultists, who have good reasons for it, consider all the forces of Nature as veritable, though supersensuous, states of Matter; and as possible objects of perception to beings endowed with the requisite senses.

>Discussing and explaining the nature of the invisible Elements and the “Primordial Fire” mentioned above, Éliphas Lévi invariably calls it the “Astral Light”: with him it is the “Grand Agent Magique.” Undeniably it is so, but—only so far as Black Magic is concerned, and on the lowest planes of what we call Ether, the noumenon of which is Âkâsha; and even this would be held incorrect by orthodox Occultists. The “Astral Light” is simply the older “Sidereal Light” of Paracelsus; and to say that “everything which exists has been evolved from it, and it preserves and reproduces all forms,” as he does, is to enunciate truth only in the second proposition. The first is erroneous; for if all that exists was evolved through (or viâ) it, this is not the Astral Light, since the latter is not the container of all things but, at best, only the reflector of this all. Éliphas Lévi very truly shows it “a force in Nature,” by means of which “a single man who can master it ... might throw the world into confusion and transform its face”; for it is the “Great Arcanum of transcendent Magic.” Quoting the words of the great Western Kabalist in their translated form, we may, perhaps, the better explain them by the occasional addition of a word or two, to show the difference between Western and Eastern explanations of the same subject. The author says of the great Magic Agent:

>* With reference to the plants and colours of the septenary employed in letic experiences, see the erudite work of M. Ragon on La Haqonnerie sion of God by increasing to infinity the idea which he forms of himself. When realising God as the infinite man, man says unto himself : I am the finite God. Magic differs from mysticism because it judges nothing & priori until after it has established CL posteriori the base itself of its judgments, that is to say, after having understood the cause by the effects contained in the very energy of the cause, by means of the universal law of analogy. Hence in the occult sciences all is real, and theories are established only on the foundations of experience. Eealities alone constitute the proportions of the ideal, and the magus admits nothing as certain in the domain of ideas save that which is demonstrated by realisation. In other words, what is true in the cause manifests in the effect. What is not realised does not exist. The realisation of speech is the logos properly so called. A thought realises itself in becoming speech ; it realises itself also by signs, sounds, and representations of signs : this is the first degree of realisation. Then it is imprinted on the astral light by means of the signs of writing or speech ; it influences other minds by reflection upon them ; it is refracted by crossing the diaphane of other men ; it assumes new forms and proportions ; it is then translated into acts and modifies the world : this is the last degree of realisation. Men who are born into a world modified by an idea bear away with them the impression thereof, and it is thus that the word is made flesh. The impression of the disobedience of Adam, preserved in the astral light, could only be effaced by the stronger impression of the obedience of the Saviour, and thus the original sin and redemption of the world can be explained in a natural and magical sense. The astral light, or soul of the world, was the instrument of Adam's omnipotence ; it became afterwards the instrument of his punishment, being corrupted and troubled by his sin, which intermingled an impure reflection with those primitive images which composed the book of universal science for his still virgin imagination.
## 8: Levi (1856) 124 [3]

>The great initiator of Christianity, divining that the astral light was overcharged with the impure reflections of Roman debauchery, sought to separate his disciples from the ambient sphere of reflections, and to make them attentive only to the interior light, so that, through the medium of a common faith and enthusiasm, they might communicate together by new magnetic chains, which he termed grace, and thus overcome the dissolute currents, to which he gave the names of the devil and Satan, signifying their putrefaction. To oppose current to current is to renew the power of fluidic life. The revealers have, therefore, scarcely done more than divine, by the accuracy of their calculations, the appropriate moment for moral reactions. The law of realisation produces what we call magnetic breathing ; places and objects become impregnated therewith, and this communicates to them an influence in conformity with our dominant desires, with those, above all, which are confirmed and realised by acts. As a fact, the universal agent, or latent astral light, ever seeks equilibrium ; it fills the void and sucks up the plenitude, which makes vice contagious, like certain physical maladies, and works powerfully in the proselytism of virtue. Hence it is that cohabitation with antipathetic beings is a torment ; hence it is that relics, whether of saints or of great criminals, produce the extraordinary results of sudden conversion and

>The astral light, transformed at the moment of conception into human light, is the soul's first envelope, and, in combination with extremely subtle fluids, it forms the ethereal body or sidereal phantom, of which Paracelsus discourses in his philosophy of intuition philosophia sagax. This sidereal body, setting itself free at death, attracts, and for a long time preserves, through the sympathy of things homogeneous, the reflections of the past life; if drawn along a special current by a will which is powerfully sympathetic, it manifests naturally, for there is nothing more natural than prodigies. It is thus apparitions are produced. But we shall develop this point more fully in the chapter devoted to Necromancy. This fluidic body, subject, like the mass of the astral light, to two contrary movements, attracting on the left and repelling on the right, or reciprocally, between the two sexes, begets various impulses within us, and contributes to solicitudes of conscience; it is frequently influenced by reflections of other minds, and thus are produced, on the one hand, temptations, and, on the other, profound and unexpected graces. This is also the explanation of the traditional doctrine of two angels who strengthen and tempt us. The two forces of the astral light may be represented by a balance wherein are weighed our good intentions for the triumph of justice and the emancipation of our liberty.

>It is possible to die through the love of certain people as by their hate ; there are absorbing passions, under the breath of which we feel ourselves depleted like the spouses of vampires. Not only do the wicked torment the good, but unconsciously the good torture the wicked. The gentleness of Abel was a long and painful bewitchment for the ferocity of Cain. Among evil men, the hatred of good originates in the very instinct of self-preservation ; moreover, they deny that what torments them is good, and, for their own peace, are driven to deify and justify evil. In the sight of Cain, Abel was a hypocrite and coward, who abused the pride of humanity by his scandalous submissions to divinity. How much must this first murderer have endured before making such a frightful attack upon his brother ? Had Abel understood, he would have been afraid. Antipathy is the presentiment of a possible bewitchment, either of love or hatred, for we find love frequently succeeding repulsion. The astral light warns us of coming influences by its action on the more or less sensible, more or less active, nervous system. Instantaneous sympathies, electric loves, are explosions of the astral light, which are as exactly and mathematically demonstrable as the discharge of strong magnetic batteries. Thereby we may see what unexpected dangers threaten an uninitiated person who is perpetually fooling with fire in the neighbourhood of invisible powder-mines. We are saturated with the astral light, and we project it unceasingly to make room for and to attract fresh supplies. The nervous instruments, which are specially designed either for attraction or projection, are the eyes and hands. The polarity of the hands is resident in the thumb, and hence, according to the magical tradition which still lingers in rural places, whenever anyone is in suspicious company, he should keep the thumb doubled up and hidden in the hand, and while in the main avoiding a fixed glance at any one, still being the first to look at those whom we have reason to fear, so as to escape unexpected fluidic projections and fascinating regards.

>Somnambulism, presentiments, and second sight are simply an accidental or induced disposition to dream in a voluntary or awakened sleep that is, to perceive the analogous reflections of the astral light, as we shall explain to demonstration in our Ritual, wihen providing the long -sought method of regularly prdducing and directing magnetic phenomena. As to divinatory instruments, they are simply a means of communication between diviner and consulter, serving merely to fix the two wills upon the same sign. Vague, complex, shifting figures help to focus the reflections of the astral fluid, and it is thus that lucidity is procured by coffee-grouts, mists, the white of egg, &c., which evoke fatidic forms, existing only in the translucid that is, in the imagination of the operators. Vision in water is worked by the dazzlement and tiring of the optic nerve, which then resigns its functions to the translucid, and produces a brain illusion in which the reflections of the astral light are taken for real images. Hence nervous persons, of weak sight and lively imagination, are most fitted for this species of divination, which, indeed, is most successful when performed by children. Let us not here misinterpret the function which we attribute to imagination in divinatory arts. It is by imagination assuredly that we see, and this is the natural aspect of the miracle, but we see true things, and in this consists the marvellous aspect of the natural work. We appeal to the experience of all veritable adepts. The author of this book has tested all kinds of divination, and has invariably obtained results in proportion to the exactitude of his scientific operations and the good faith of his consulters.

>Y immobility ; whatsoever obeys more naturally and readily the law of motion, they term volatile ; and they compose their stone by analysis, that is, the volatilisation of the fixed ; then by synthesis, that is, the fixation of the volatile, which they operate by applying to the fixed, called their salt, sulphurated mercury or light of life, directed and rendered omnipotent by a secret operation. They possess themselves in this manner of all nature, and their stone is found wherever there is salt, which is equivalent to saying that no substance is foreign to the great work, and that even the most apparently contemptible and vile matters can be changed into gold, which is true in this sense, as we have said, that all contain the fundamental salt, represented in our emblems by the cubic stone itself, as may be seen in the symbolic and universal frontispiece to the keys of Basil Valentine. To know how to extract from all matter the pure salt which is concealed in it is to possess the secret of the stone. It is, therefore, a saline stone, which the od, or universal astral light, decomposes or recomposes. It is one and many, for, like ordinary salt, it can be dissolved and incorporated with other substances. Obtained by analysis, it may be termed the universal sublimate ; recovered by the synthetic way, it is the veritable panacea of the ancients, for it cures all diseases, whether of soul or body, and is termed, in an eminent manner, the medicine of all nature. When, by means of absolute initiation, we can dispose of the forces of the universal agent, this stone is always to our hand, for its extraction is then a simple and easy operation, far different from projection or metallic realisation. The stone in its sublimated state must not be exposed to the air, which might dissolve it and spoil its virtue. Moreover, to inhale its exhalations is not devoid of danger. The wise man more readily conserves it in its natural envelopes, knowing that he can extract it by a single effort of his will, and a single application of the universal agent to the envelopes, which the kabbalists term shells. To express hieroglyphically this law of prudence, the sages of Egypt ascribed to their mercury, personified as Hermanubis, a dog's head, and to their sulphur, represented by the Baphomet of the temple, or prince of the Sabbath, that goat's head which brought such odium upon the occult associations of the middle ages.

>Thus, while in the metaphysical world, the Circle with the one central Point in it has no number, and is called Anupâdaka—parentless and numberless, for it can fall under no calculation; in the manifested world, the Mundane Egg or Circle is circumscribed within the groups called the Line, the Triangle, the Pentagram, the second Line and the Square (or 13514); and when the Point has generated a Line, and thus becomes a diameter which stands for the androgynous Logos, then the figures become 31415, or a triangle, a line, a square, a second line, and a pentagram. “When the Son separates from the Mother he becomes the Father,” the diameter standing for Nature, or the feminine principle. Therefore it is said: “In the World of Being, the One Point fructifies the Line, the Virgin Matrix of Kosmos [the egg‐shaped zero], and the immaculate Mother gives birth to the Form that combines all forms.” Prajâpati is called the first procreating male, and “his mother’s husband.” This gives the key‐note to all the later “Divine Sons” from “Immaculate Mothers.” It is strongly corroborated by the significant fact that Anna, the name of the Mother of the Virgin Mary, now represented by the Roman Catholic Church as having given birth to her daughter in an immaculate way (“Mary conceived without sin”), is derived from the Chaldean Ana, Heaven, or Astral Light, Anima Mundi; whence Anaitia, Devî‐Durgâ, the wife of Shiva, is also called Annapurna, and Kanyâ, the Virgin; Umâ‐Kanyâ being her esoteric name, and meaning the “Virgin of Light,” Astral Light in one of its multitudinous aspects.

But the Astral Light, though only the lower aspect of the Absolute, is still dual. It is the Anima Mundi, and ought never to be viewed otherwise, except for Kabalistic purposes. The difference which exists between its “Light” and its “Living Fire,” ought ever to be present in the mind of the Seer and the Psychic. The higher aspect of this “Light,” without which only creatures of matter can be produced, is this Living Fire, and its Seventh Principle. It is stated in Isis Unveiled, in a complete description of it:

>In Volume II of the same work, the philosophical systems of the Gnostics and the primitive Jewish Christians, the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, are fully considered. They show the views held in those days, outside the circle of Mosaic Jews, about Jehovah. He was identified by all the Gnostics with the evil, rather than with the good principle. For them, he was Ilda‐Baoth, the “Son of Darkness,” whose mother, Sophia Achamôth, was the daughter of Sophia, the Divine Wisdom—the female Holy Ghost of the early Christians—Âkâsha; Sophia Achamôth personifying the Lower Astral Light or Ether. The Astral Light stands in the same relation to Âkâsha and Anima Mundi, as Satan stands to the Deity. They are one and the same thing seen from two aspects, the spiritual and the psychic—the super‐ethereal, or connecting link between matter and pure spirit—and the physical. Ilda‐Baoth—a compound name, made up of Ilda (ילד), child, and Baoth; the latter from בהוצ an egg, and בהות, chaos, emptiness, void, or desolation; or the Child born in the Egg of Chaos, like Brahmâ—or Jehovah, is simply one of the Elohim, the Seven Creative Spirits, and one of the lower Sephiroth. Ilda‐Baoth produces from himself seven other Gods, “Stellar Spirits,” or the Lunar Ancestors, for they are all the same. They are all in his own image, the “Spirits of the Face,” and the reflections one of the other, who become darker and more material, as they successively recede from their originator. They also inhabit seven regions disposed like a stair, for its steps mount and descend the scale of spirit and matter. With Pagans and Christians, with Hindûs and Chaldeans, with Greek as with Roman Catholics—the texts varying slightly in their interpretations—they all were the Genii of the seven planets, and of the seven planetary spheres of our septenary Chain, of which Earth is the lowest. This connects the “Stellar” and “Lunar” Spirits with the higher planetary Angels, and the Saptarshis, the Seven Rishis of the Stars, of the Hindûs—as subordinate Angels, or Messengers, to these Rishis, their emanations, on the descending scale. Such, in the opinion of the philosophical Gnostics, were the God and the Archangels now worshipped by the Christians! The “Fallen Angels” and the legend of the “War in Heaven” are thus purely pagan in their origin, and come from India, viá Persia and Chaldea. The only reference to them in the Christian canon is found in Revelation xii, as quoted a few pages back.

>So far he is right enough. But when the great authority of the Western Kabalists adds that, nevertheless, “it is not the immortal Spirit, as the Indian Hierophants have imagined”—we answer, that he slanders the said Hierophants, as they have said nothing of the kind; for even the Purânic exoteric writings flatly contradict the assertion. No Hindû has ever mistaken Prakriti—the Astral Light being only above the lowest plane of Prakriti, the Material Kosmos—for the “immortal Spirit.” Prakriti is ever called Mâyâ, Illusion, and is doomed to disappear with the rest, the Gods included, at the hour of the Pralaya. As it is shown that Âkâsha is not even the Ether, least of all then, we imagine, can it be the Astral Light. Those unable to penetrate beyond the dead letter of the Purânas, have occasionally confused Âkâsha with Prakriti, with Ether, and even with the visible Sky! It is true also that those who have invariably translated the term Âkâsha by “Ether”—Wilson, for instance—finding it called “the material cause of sound” possessing, moreover, this one single property, have ignorantly imagined it to be “material,” in the physical sense. True, again, that if the characteristics are accepted literally, then, since nothing material or physical, and therefore conditioned and temporary, can be immortal—according to metaphysics and philosophy—it would follow that Âkâsha is neither infinite nor immortal. But all this is erroneous, since both the words Pradhâna, Primeval Matter, and Sound, as a property, have been misunderstood; the former term (Pradhâna) being certainly synonymous with Mûlaprakriti and Âkâsha, and the latter (Sound) with the Verbum, the Word or the Logos. This is easy to demonstrate; for it is shown in the following sentence from Vishnu Purâna. “There was neither day nor night, nor sky, nor earth, nor darkness, nor light, nor any other thing, save only One, unapprehensible by intellect, or that which is Brahman, and Pums, [Spirit] and Pradhâna [Primordial Matter].”

>These are the reasons why the Occultists refuse to give the name of Astral Light to Âkâsha, or to call it Ether. “In my Father’s house are many mansions,” may be contrasted with the Occult saying, “In our Mother’s house are seven mansions,” or planes, the lowest of which is above and around us—the Astral Light.

>Zeus‐Zên (Æther), and Chthonia (Chaotic Earth) and Metis (Water), his wives; Osiris—also representing Æther, the first emanation of the Supreme Deity, Amun, the primeval source of Light—and Isis- Latona, the Goddess Earth and Water again; Mithras, the rock- born God, the symbol of the male Mundane Fire, or the personified Primordial Light, and Mithra, the Fire‐Goddess, at once his mother and his wife—the pure element of Fire, the active or male principle, regarded as light and heat, in conjunction with Earth and Water, or matter, the female, or passive, element of cosmical generation—Mithras who is the son of Bordj, the Persian mundane mountain, from which he flashed out as a radiant ray of light; Brahmâ, the Fire‐God, and his prolific consort; and the Hindû Agni, the refulgent Deity from whose body issue a thousand streams of glory and seven tongues of flame, and in whose honour certain Brâhmans to this day maintain a perpetual fire; Shiva, personated by Meru, the mundane mountain of the Hindûs, the terrific Fire‐God, who is said in the legend to have descended from heaven, like the Jewish Jehovah, “in a pillar of fire”; and a dozen other archaic double‐sexed Deities—all loudly proclaim their hidden meaning. And what could be the dual meaning of these myths but the psycho‐chemical principle of primordial creation; the First Evolution, in its triple manifestation of Spirit, Force and Matter; the divine correlation, at its starting point, allegorized as the marriage of Fire and Water, the products of electrifying Spirit—the union of the male active principle with the female passive element—which become the parents of their tellurian child, Cosmic Matter, the Prima Materia, whose Soul is Æther, and whose Shadow is the Astral Light!

>The Chaldean Oracles speak of the “Mundane God, eternal, boundless, young and old, of winding form.” This “winding form” is a figure to express the vibratory motion of the Astral Light, with which the ancient priests were perfectly well acquainted, though the name “Astral Light” was invented by the Martinists.

>Hence, the Kurios, or Logos, born from it, was, with the Greeks, the God, Mind (Nous). “Now Koros [Kurios] ... signifies the pure and unmixed nature of Intellect—Wisdom,” says Plato, in Cratylus; and Kurios is Mercury (Mercurius, Mar‐kurios), the Divine Wisdom, and “Mercury is Sol [the Sun],” from whom Thot‐Hermes received this Divine Wisdom. While, then, the Logoi of all countries and religions are correlative, in their sexual aspects, with the female Soul of the World or the Great Deep, the Deity, from which these Two in One have their being, is ever concealed and called the Hidden One, and is connected only indirectly with “Creation,” as it can act only through the Dual Force emanating from the Eternal Essence. Even Æsculapius, called the “Saviour of all,” is identical, according to ancient classical writers, with the Egyptian Ptah, the Creative Intellect, or Divine Wisdom, and with Apollo, Baal, Adonis and Hercules: and Ptah, in one of its aspects, is the Anima Mundi; the Universal Soul of Plato; the Divine Spirit of the Egyptians; the Holy Ghost of the early Christians and Gnostics; and the Âkâsha of the Hindûs, and even, in its lower aspect, the Astral Light. For Ptah was originally the God of the Dead, he into whose bosom they were received, hence the Limbus of the Greek Christians, or the Astral Light. It was far later that Ptah was classed with the Sun‐Gods, his name signifying “he who opens,” as he is shown to be the first to unveil the face of the dead mummy, to call the Soul to life in his bosom. Kneph, the Eternal Unrevealed, is represented by the snake‐emblem of eternity encircling a water‐urn, with its head hovering over the “Waters,” which it incubates with its breath—another form of the one original idea of “Darkness,” with its Ray moving on the Waters, etc. As the Logos‐Soul, this permutation is called Ptah; as the Logos‐Creator, he becomes Imhotep, his Son, the “God of the handsome face.” In their primitive characters, these two were the first Cosmic Duad, Noot, Space or “Sky,” and Noon, the “Primordial Waters,” the Androgyne Unity, above whom was the Concealed Breath of Kneph. And all of them had the aquatic animals and plants sacred to them, the ibis, the swan, the goose, the crocodile, and the lotus.

>In the Scandinavian Cosmogony, placed by Professor Max Müller, in point of time, as “far anterior to the Vedas,” in the poem of Wöluspa, the Song of the Prophetess, the Mundane Egg is again discovered in the Phantom‐Germ of the Universe, which is represented as lying in the Ginnungagap, the Cup of Illusion, Mâyâ, the Boundless and Void Abyss. In this World’s Matrix, formerly a region of night and desolation, Nefelheim, the Mist‐Place, the nebular, as it is called now, in the Astral Light, dropped a Ray of Cold Light which overflowed this cup and froze in it. Then the Invisible blew a scorching Wind which dissolved the frozen Waters and cleared the Mist. These Waters (Chaos), called the Streams of Eliwagar, distilling in vivifying drops, fell down and created the Earth and the Giant Ymir, who had only the “semblance of man” (the Heavenly Man), and the Cow, Audumla (the “Mother,” Astral Light or Cosmic Soul), from whose udder flowed four streams of milk—the four cardinal points; the four heads of the four rivers of Eden, etc.—which “four” are symbolized by the Cube in all its various and mystical meanings.

>At this moment, when the theory of mere motion as the origin of all varieties of force is again becoming the prevailing thought, it were almost heresy to reöpen a debate, which for a period appears, by general consent, to be virtually closed; but I accept the risk, and shall state, therefore, what were the precise views of the immortal heretic, whose name I have whispered to the readers, (Samuel Metcalfe,) respecting Sun‐Force. Starting with the argument on which nearly all physicists are agreed, that there exist in nature two agencies—matter which is ponderable, visible, and tangible, and a something which is imponderable, invisible, and appreciable only by its influence on matter—Metcalfe maintains that the imponderable and active agency which he calls “caloric” is not a mere form of motion, not a vibration amongst the particles of ponderable matter, but itself a material substance flowing from the sun through space, filling the voids between the particles of solid bodies, and conveying by sensation the property called heat. The nature of caloric, or Sun‐Force, is contended for by him on the following grounds:
## 25: Blavatsky (1888) 1584 [2]

>As against the vibratory theory, Metcalfe further argues that if caloric were a mere property or quality, it could not augment the volume of other bodies; for this purpose it must itself have volume, it must occupy space, and it must, therefore, be a material agent. If caloric were only the effect of vibratory motion amongst the particles of ponderable matter, it could not radiate from hot bodies without the simultaneous transition of the vibrating particles; but the fact stands out that heat can radiate from material ponderable substance without loss of weight of such substance.... With this view as to the material nature of caloric or sun‐force; with the impression firmly fixed on his mind that “everything in Nature is composed of two descriptions of matter, the one essentially active and ethereal, the other passive and motionless,” Metcalfe based the hypothesis that the sun- force, or caloric, is a self‐active principle. For its own particles, he holds, it has repulsion; for the particles of all ponderable matter it has affinity; it attracts the particles of ponderable matter with forces which vary inversely as the squares of the distance. It thus acts through ponderable matter. If universal space were filled with caloric, sun‐force, alone (without ponderable matter), caloric would also be inactive and would constitute a boundless ocean of powerless or quiescent ether, because it would then have nothing on which to act, while ponderable matter, however inactive of itself, has “certain properties by which it modifies and controls the actions of caloric, both of which are governed by immutable laws that have their origin in the mutual relations and specific properties of each.”
## 26: Blavatsky (1888) 1588 [2]

>This distribution of solid ponderable matter through ether extends, according to the theory before us, to everything that exists at this moment. The ether is all‐pervading. The human body itself is charged with the ether [Astral Light rather]; its minute particles are held together by it; the plant is in the same condition; the most solid earth, rock, adamant, crystal, metal, all are the same. But there are differences in the capacities of different kinds of ponderable matter to receive sun‐force, and upon this depends the various changing conditions of matter; the solid, the liquid, the gaseous condition. Solid bodies have attracted caloric in excess over fluid bodies, and hence their firm cohesion; when a portion of molten zinc is poured upon a plate of solid zinc, the molten zinc becomes as solid because there is a rush of caloric from the liquid to the solid, and in the equalization the particles, previously loose or liquid, are more closely brought together.... Metcalfe himself, dwelling on the above‐named phenomena, and accounting for them by the unity of principle of action, which has already been explained, sums up his argument in very clear terms, in a comment on the densities of various bodies. “Hardness and softness,” he says, “solidity and liquidity, are not essential conditions of bodies, but depend on the relative proportions of ethereal and ponderable matter of which they are composed. The most elastic gas may be reduced to the liquid form by the abstraction of caloric, and again converted into a firm solid, the particles of which would cling together with a force proportional to their augmented affinity for caloric. On the other hand, by adding a sufficient quantity of the same principle to the densest metals, their attraction for it is diminished when they are expanded into the gaseous state, and their cohesion is destroyed.”

>There is mercy and there is justice in God ; to the just He dispenses justice and to sinners mercy. In the soul of the world, which is the universal agent, there is a current of love and a current of wrath. This ambient and allpenetrating fluid ; this ray loosened from the sun's splendour, and fixed by the weight of the atmosphere and the power of central attraction ; this body of the Holy Spirit, which we term the universal agent, while it was typified by the ancients under the symbol of a serpent devouring his tail ; this electro-magnetic ether, this vital and luminous caloric, is depicted in archaic monuments by the girdle of Isis, twicefolded in a love-knot round two poles, as well as by the serpent devouring his own tail, emblematic of prudence and of Saturn. Motion and life consist in the extreme tension of two forces. " I would thou wert cold or hot," said the Master. As a fact, a great sinner is more really alive than is a tepid, effeminate man, and the fulness of his return to virtue will be in proportion to the extent of his errors. She who is destined to crush the serpent's head is intelligence, which ever rises above the stream of blind forces. The Kabbalists call her the virgin of the sea, whose dripping feet the infernal dragon, stupefied by delight, crawls forward to lick with his fiery tongues. These are the hieratic mysteries of the duad. But there is one, and the last of all, which must not be made known, the reason, according to Hermes Trismegistus, being the malcomprehension of the vulgar, who would ascribe to the necessities of science the immoral aspect of blind fatality. " By the fear of the unknown must the crowd be restrained," he observes in another place, and Christ also said : " Cast not your pearls before swine, lest, trampling them under their feet, they turn and rend you." The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of which the fruits are death, is the type of this hieratic secret of the duad, which could only be misconstrued if divulged, and would lead commonly to the unholy denial of free will, which is the principle of moral life. It is hence in the essence of things that the revelation of this secret means death, and it is not at the same time the great secret of magic ; but the arcanum of the duad leads up to that of the tetrad, or more correctly proceeds therefrom, and is resolved by the triad, which contains the word of the enigma propounded by the sphinx, as it was required to have been found in order to save the life, atone for the unconscious crime, and establish the Kingdom of (Edipus.

>The empire of the will over the astral light, which is the physical soul of the four elements, is represented in magic by the pentagram, which we have set at the head of this chapter. The elementary spirits are subservient to this sign when employed with understanding, and, by placing it in the circle or on the table of evocations, they can be rendered tractable, which is magically called to imprison them. Let us briefly explain this marvel. All created beings communicate with one another by signs, and all adhere to a certain number of truths expressed by determinate forms. The perfection of forms increases in proportion to the detachment of spirits, and those that are not overweighted by the chains of matter, recognise by intuition out of hand whether a sign is the expression of a real power or of a precipitate will. The intelligence of the wise man therefore gives value to his pantacle, as science gives weight to his will, and spirits comprehend this power immediately. Thus, by means of the pentagram, spirits can be forced to appear in vision, whether in the waking or sleeping state, by themselves leading before our diaphane their reflection, which exists in the astral light, if they have lived, or a reflection analogous to their spiritual logos if they have not lived on earth. This explains all visions, and accounts for the dead invariably appearing to seers, either such as they were upon earth, or such as they are in the grave, never as they subsist in a condition which escapes the perceptions of our actual organism.

>When the magnetic atmosphere of two persons is so equilibrated that the attractive faculty of one draws the expansive faculty of the other, a tendency is produced which is termed sympathy ; then imagination, calling up to it all the rays or reflections analogous to that which it experiences, makes a poem of the desires which captivate the will, and, if the persons differ in sex, it occasions in them, or more commonly in the weaker of the two, a complete intoxication of the astral light, which is termed passion par excellence, or love. Love is one of the great instruments of magical power, but it is categorically forbidden to the magus, at least as an intoxication or passion. Woe to the Samson of the Kabbalah if he permit himself to be put asleep by Delilah ! The Hercules of science, who exchanges his royal sceptre for the distaff of Omphale, will soon experience the vengeance of Dejanira, and nothing will be left for him but the pyre of Mount (Eta*, in order to escape the devouring folds of the coat of Nessus. Sexual love is ever an illusion, for it is the result of an imaginary mirage. The astral light is the universal seducer, typified by the serpent of Genesis. This subtle agent, ever active, ever abounding in sap, ever fruitful in alluring dreams and sensuous images ; this force, which by itself is blind and subordinated to every will, whether for good or evil ; this every renewing circulus of unbridled life, which produces vertigo in the imprudent ; this corporal spirit ; this fiery body ; this impalpable omnipresent ether; this monstrous seduction of nature how shall we define it comprehensively and how characterise its action ? To some extent indifferent in itself, it lends itself to good as to evil ; it transmits light and propagates darkness ; it may be called equally Lucifer and Lucifuge ; it is a serpent but it is also an aureole ; it is a fire, but it may belong equally to the torments of infernus, or to the sacrifice of incense offered up to heaven. To dispose of it, we must, like the predestined women, set our foot upon its head.

>The astral light, depicted in ancient symbols by the serpent devouring his tail, represents alternately malice and prudence, time and eternity, tempter and Redeemer ; for this light, being the vehicle of life, is an auxiliary alike of good and evil, and may be taken for the fiery form of Satan as for the body of the Holy Ghost. It is the instrument of warfare in angelic battles, and indifferently feeds the flames of hell and the lightnings of St Michael. It may be compared to a horse having a nature analogous to the chameleon, and ever reflecting the armour of his rider. The astral light is the realisation or form of the intellectual light, as the latter is the realisation or form of the divine light.

>There is an outbreathing and inbreathing of the soul, exactly like that of the body. It breathes in the felicity which it believes, and it breathes forth ideas which result from its inner sensations. Diseased souls have an evil breath, and vitiate their moral atmosphere that is, they combine impure reflections with the astral light which permeates them, and establish unwholesome currents therein. We are often invaded, to our astonishment, in society by evil thoughts which would have seemed impossible, and are not aware that they are due to some morbid proximity. This secret is of high importance, for it leads to the opening of consciences, one of the most incontestible and terrible powers of magical art. Magnetic respiration produces about the soul a radiation of which it is the centre, and surrounds it with the reflection of its works, creating for it a heaven or a hell. There are no isolated acts, and it is impossible that there should be secret acts; whatsoever we truly will that is, everything which we confirm by our acts remains registered in the astral light, where our reflections are preserved. These reflections continually influence our thought by the mediation of the diaphane, and it is in this sense that we become and remain the children of our works.

>11 3 L THE MANUS THE great magical agent, by us termed the astral light, by others the soul of the earth, and designated by old chemists under the names of Azoth and Magnesia, this occult, unique, and indubitable force, is the key of all empire, the secret of all power ; it is the winged dragon of Medea, the serpent of the Edenic mystery ; it is the universal glass of visions, the bond of sympathies, the source of love, prophecy, and glory. To know how to avail one's self of this agent is to be the trustee of God's own power ; all real, effective magic, all occult force is there, and its demonstration is the sole end of all genuine books of science. To possess one's self of the great magical agent there are two operations necessary to concentrate and project, or, in other words, to fix and to move. Fixity has been provided as the basis and guarantee of movement by the Author of all things ; the magus must go to work in like manner.

>G and when Archimedes was in want of a lever to move the world, what he sought was simply the great magical arcanum. One arm of the androgyne figure of Henry Khunrath bore the word COAGULA and the other SOLVE. To collect and diffuse are nature's two words but after what manner can we accomplish these operations with the astral light or soul of the world ? Concentration is by isolation and distribution by the magical chain. Isolation consists in absolute independence for thought, complete liberty for the heart, and perfect continence for the senses. Every man who is possessed by prejudices and fears, every passionate person who is slave of his passions, is incapable of concentrating or coagulating, according to the expression of Khunrath, the astral light or soul of the earth. All true adepts have been independent even amidst torture, sober and chaste till death. The explanation of such anomaly is this in order to dispose of a force, you must not be surprised by this force in a way that it may dispose of you. But then, cry out those who seek only in magic for a method of inordinately satisfying the lusts of nature, what good is a power which must not be used for our own satisfaction ? Unhappy creatures who ask, if I told you, how could you grasp it ? Are pearls nothing because they are worthless to the horde of Epicurus ? Did not Curtius prefer the government of those who had gold than its possession by himself ? Must we not be something removed from the common man when we almost pretend to be God ? Moreover, I grieve to deject or discourage you, but I am not devising the transcendental sciences ; I teach them, defining their immutable necessities in the presentation of their primary and most inexorable conditions. Pythagoras was a free, sober, and chaste man ; Apollonius of Tyana and Julius Caesar were both of repellent austerity ; the sex of Paracelsus was suspected, so foreign was he to the weakness of love; Kaymond Lully carried the severity of life to the most exalted point of asceticism ; Jerome Cardan exaggerated the practice of fasting till he nearly perished of starvation, if we may accept tradition ; Agrippa, poor and buffeted from town to town, almost died of misery rather than yield to the caprice of a princess who insulted the liberty of science. What then made the felicity of these men ? The knowledge of great secrets and the consciousness of power. It was sufficient for those great souls. Must one be like unto them in order to know what they knew ? Assuredly not, and the existence of this book is perhaps a case in point ; but in order to do what they did, it is absolutely necessary to take the means which they took. But what did they actually accomplish ? They astonished and subdued the world; they reigned more truly than kings. Magic is an instrument of divine goodness or demoniac pride, but it is the annihilation of earthly joys and the pleasures of mortal life. Why study it ? ask the luxurious. Merely to know it and possibly after to learn mistrust of stupid unbelief or puerile credulity. Men of pleasure, and half of these I count for so many women, is not gratified curiosity highly pleasurable ? Read therefore without fear, you will not be magicians against your will. Readiness for absolute renunciation is, moreover, necessary only in order to establish universal currents and transform the face of the world; there are relative magical operations, limited to a certain circle, which do not need such heroic virtues. We can act upon passions by passions, determine sympathies or antipathies, hurt even and heal, without possessing the omnipotence of the magus ; in this case, however, we must realise the risk of a reaction in proportion to the action, to which we may easily fall a victim. All this will be explained in our Ritual.

>When a man has lived well the astral body evaporates like a pure incense ascending towards the upper regions ; but should he have lived in sin, his astral body, which holds him prisoner, still seeks the objects of its passions, and wishes to return to life. It torments the dreams of young girls, bathes in the steam of spilt blood, and floats about the places where the pleasures of its life elapsed ; it still watches over treasures which it possessed and buried; it expends itself in painful efforts to make fresh material organs and so live again. But the stars draw it up and absorb it ; its feels its intelligence weaken, its memory gradually vanishes, all its being dissolves. . . . Its former vices rise up before it, assume monstrous shapes, and pursue it ; they attack and devour it. ... The unfortunate creature thus successively loses all the members which have ministered to his iniquities ; then he dies a second time and for ever, because he loses his personality and his memory. Souls which are destined to live, but are not yet completely purified, remain captive for a longer or shorter period in the astral body, wherein they are burned by the odic light, which seeks to absorb and dissolve them. It is in order to escape from this body that suffering souls sometimes enter the bodies of the living and therein dwell in that state which Kabbalists term embryonic. Now, it is these aerial bodies which are evoked by necromancy. We enter into connection with larvae, with dead or perishing substances, by this operation. The beings in question, for the most part, cannot speak except by the tingling of our ears produced by the nervous shock to which I have referred, and commonly they can only reason by reflecting our thoughts and our reveries. To behold these strange forms, we must put ourselves in abnormal condition akin to sleep or death, in other words, we must magnetise ourselves and enter into a kind of lucid and waking somnambulism. Then necromancy has real results, and then the evocations of magic can produce actual visions. We have said that in the great magical agent, which is the astral light, there are preserved all impressions of things, all images formed either by rays or reflections ; in this same light our visions come to us, and it is this which intoxicates the insane, and leads away their dormant judgment in pursuit of the most bizarre phantoms. To insure vision without illusion in this light, a powerful will must be with us to isolate reflections and attract rays only. To dream awake is to see in the astral light, and the orgies of the Sabbath, described by so many sorcerers in their criminal trials, came to them solely in this manner. The preparations and the substances used to obtain this result were often horrible, as we shall see in the Ritual, but the result itself was never doubtful. They beheld, they heard, they handled the most abominable, most fantastic, most impossible things. We shall return to this subject in our fifteenth chapter ; at the present moment we are concerned only with the evocations of the dead.

What makes the were-wolf visible is the almost somnamic excitement caused by the fright of those who behold it, or else the tendency, more particularly in simple country persons, to enter into direct communication with the astral light, which is the common medium of visions and dreams. The hurts inflicted on the were-wolf really wound the sleeping person by the odic and sympathetic congestion of the astral light, and by the correspondence of the immaterial with the material body.

>To these phenomena and to the occult laws which govern them must be referred the effects of bewitchment, of which we shall speak hereafter. Diabolical obsessions, and the majority of nervous diseases which affect the brain, are wounds inflicted on the nervous mechanism by the astral light when perverted, that is, absorbed or projected in abnormal proportions. All extraordinary and extra-natural tensions of the will predispose to obsessions and nervous diseases ; enforced celibacy, asceticism, hatred, ambition, rejected love, are so many generative principles of infernal forms and influences. Paracelsus says that the menstruations of women beget phantoms in the air, and from this standpoint convents would be seminaries for nightmares, while the devils might be compared to those heads of the hydra of Lerne which were reproduced eternally and propagated in the very blood from their wounds. The phenomena of possession amongst the Ursulines of Loudun, so fatal to Urban Grandier, have been misconstrued. The nuns were really possessed by hysteria and fanatical imitation of the secret thoughts of their exorcists, which were transmitted to their nervous system by the astral light. They received the impression of all the hatreds which this unfortunate priest had conjured up against him, and this wholly interior communication seemed diabolical and miraculous to themselves. Hence in this tragical affair everyone acted sincerely, even to Laubardemont, who, in his blind execution of the prejudged verdicts of Cardinal Richelieu, believed that he was fulfilling at the same time the duties of a true judge, and as little suspected himself of being a follower of Pontius Pilate as he would have recognised in the sceptical and libertine curd of Saint-Pierre-du Marchd, a disciple and martyr of Christ. The possession of the nuns of Louvier is scarcely more than a copy of those of Loudun ; the devils invent little and plagiarise one another. The process of Gaufridi and Magdalen de la Palud possesses stranger features, for in this case the victims are their own accusers. Gaufridi confessed that he was guilty of depriving a number of women of the power to defend themselves against his seductions by simply breathing in their nostrils. A young and beautiful girl, of noble family, who had been thus insufflated, described, in the greatest detail, scenes wherein the unchaste seemed to vie with the monstrous and grotesque. Such are the ordinary hallucinations of false mysticism and ill-kept celibacy. Gaufridi and his mistress were obsessed by their mutual chimeras, and the brain of the one reflected the nightmares of the other. Was not the Marquis of Sade himself infectious for certain depleted and diseased natures ?

>The old serpent of the legend is nothing else than the universal agent, the eternal fire of terrestrial life, the soul of the earth, and the living fount of hell. We have said that the astral light is the receptacle of forms, and these when evoked by reason are produced harmoniously, but when evoked by madness they appear disorderly and monstrous ; so originated the nightmares of St Anthony and the phantoms of the Sabbath. Do, therefore, the evocations of goetia and demonomania possess a practical result ? Yes, certainly one which cannot be contested, one more terrible than could be recounted by legends ! When any one invokes the devil with intentional ceremonies, the devil comes, and is seen. To escape dying from horror at the sight, to escape catalepsy or idiocy, one must be already mad. Grandier was a libertine through indevotion, and perhaps also through scepticism ; excessive zeal, following on the aberrations of asceticism and blindness of faith, depraved Girard, and made him deprave in his turn. In the fifteenth chapter of our Eitual we shall give all the diabolical evocations and practices of black magic, not that they may be used, but that they may be known and judged, and that such insanities may be put aside for ever.

>There are certain animals which have the power of breaking the currents of astral light by an absorption peculiar to themselves. They are violently antipathetic to us, and possess a certain sorcery of the eye : the toad, the basilisk, and the tard are instances. These animals, when tamed and carried alive on the person, or kept in occupied rooms, are a guarantee against the hallucinations and trickeries of ASTRAL INTOXICATION, a term we make use of here for the first time, one which explains all the phenomena of unbridled passions, mental exaltations, and folly. Tame toads and tards, my dear sir, the disciple of Voltaire will say to me; carry them about with you, and write no more. To which I may answer, that I shall seriously think of doing so as soon as ever I feel tempted to laugh at anything I do not understand, and to treat those whose knowledge and wisdom I fail to understand, as fools or as madmen. Paracelsus, the greatest of the Christian magi, opposed bewitchment by the practices of a contrary bewitchment. He composed sympathetic remedies, and applied them, not to the suffering members, but to representations of those members, formed and consecrated according to magical ceremonial. His successes were incredible, and never has any physician approached Paracelsus in his marvels of healing. But Paracelsus had discovered magnetism long before Mesmer, and had carried to its final consequences this luminous discovery, or rather this initiation into the magic of the ancients, who better than us understood the great magical agent, and did not regard the astral light, azoth, the universal magnesia of the sages, as an animal and a special fluid emanating only from particular creatures. In his occult philosophy, Paracelsus opposes ceremonial magic, the terrible power of which he certainly did not ignore, but he sought to decry its practices so as to discredit black magic. He locates the omnipotence of the magus in the interior and occult magnes, and the most skilful magnetisers of our own day could not express themselves better. At the same time he counselled the employment of magical symbols, talismans above all, in the cure of diseases. In our eighteenth chapter we shall have occasion to return to the talismans of Paracelsus, while following Gaffarel upon the great question of occult iconography and numismatics.

>To be a diviner, according to the force of the term, is hence to be divine, and something more mysterious still. Now, the two signs of human divinity, or of divine humanity, are prophecies and miracles. To be a prophet is to see beforehand the effects which exist in causes, to read in the astral light ; to work miracles is to act upon the universal agent, and subject it to our will. The author of this book will be asked whether he is a prophet and thaumaturge. Let inquirers recur to all that he wrote before certain events took place in the world ; and as to anything else that he may have said or done, would anyone believe his mere word if he made any unusual statement? Furthermore, one of the essential conditions of divination is to be never constrained, never suffer temptation in other words, being put to the test. Never have the masters of science yielded to the curiosity of anyone. The sibyls burned their books when Tarquin refused to appraise them at their proper value ; the great Master was silent when He was asked for a sign of His divine mission ; Agrippa perished of want rather than obey those who demanded a horoscope. To furnish proofs of science to those who suspect the very existence of the science is to initiate the unworthy, to profane the gold of the sanctuary, to deserve the excommunication of sages, and the fate of betrayers.

>We have said that impassioned ecstasy may produce the same results as absolute superiority, and this is true as to the issue, but not as to the direction of magical operations. Passion forcibly projects the astral light and impresses unforeseen movements on the universal agent, but it cannot check with the facility that it impels, and its destiny then resembles Hippolytus dragged by his own horses, or Phalaris himself victimised by the instrument of torture which he had invented for others. Human volition realised by action is like a cannon-ball, and recedes before no obstacle. It either passes through it or is buried in it, but if it advance with patience and perseverance, it is never lost ; it is like the wave which returns incessantly and wears away iron in the end.
## 41: Levi (1856) 273 [2]

>The pentagram, or sign of the microcosmos, represents, among other magical mysteries, the double sympathy of the human extremities with each other and with the circulation of the astral light in the human body. Thus, when a man is represented in the star of the pentagram, as may be seen in the " Occult Philosophy" of Agrippa, it should be observed that the head corresponds in masculine sympathy with the right foot and in feminine sympathy with the left foot ; that the right hand corresponds in the same way with the left hand and left foot, and reciprocally of the other hand. This must be borne in mind when making magnetic passes, if we seek to govern the whole organism and bind all members by their proper chains of analogy and natural sympathy. The same knowledge is necessary for the use of the pentagram in the conjuration of spirits, and in the evocation of errant spirits in the astral light, vulgarly called necromancy, as we shall explain in the fifth chapter of this Kitual. But it is well to observe here that every action promotes a reaction, and that in magnetising others, or influencing them magically, we establish between them and ourselves a current of contrary but analogous influence which may subject us to them instead of subjecting them to us, as happens frequently enough in those operations which have the sympathy of love for their object. Hence it is highly essential to be on our defence while we are attacking, so as not to aspire on the left while we respire on the right. The magical androgyne depicted in the frontispiece of the Eitual has SOLVE inscribed upon the right and COGULA on the left arm, which corresponds to the symbolical figure of the architects of the second temple, who bore their sword in one hand and their trowel in the other. While building they had also to defend their work and disperse their enemies ; nature herself does likewise, destroying and regenerating at the same time. Now, according to the allegory of Duchentau's Magical Calendar, man, that is to say, the initiate, is the ape of nature, who confines him by a chain, but makes him act unceasingly, imitating the proceedings and works of his divine mistress and imperishable model.
## 42: Levi (1856) 328 [2]

>If it have been hitherto impossible to direct the phenomena of magnetism, it is because an initiated and truly emancipated operator has not yet appeared. Who can boast that he is such ? Have we not ever new self-conquest? to make ? At the same time, it is certain that natu will obey the sign and the word of one who feels L self strong enough to be convinced of it. I say tl nature will obey ; I do not say that she will bely hers* or disturb the order of her possibilities. The healing nervous diseases by word, breath, or contact ; resurrection in certain cases ; resistance of evil wills sufficient to disarm and confound murderers ; even the faculty of making one's self invisible by troubling the sight of those whom it is important to elude ; all this is a natural effect of projecting or withdrawing the astral light. Thus was Valentius dazzled and terror-struck on entering the temple of Cesarea, even as Heliodorus of old, overcome by a sudden madness in the temple of Jerusalem, believed himself scourged and trampled by angels. Thus also the Admiral de Coligny imposed respect on his assassins, and could only be despatched by a madman who fell upon him with averted head. What rendered Joan of Arc invariably victorious was the fascination of her faith and the miracle of her audacity ; she paralysed the arms of those who would have assailed her, and the English may have very well been sincere in regarding her as a witch or a sorceress. As a fact, she was a sorceress unconsciously, herself believing that she acted supernaturally, while she was really disposing of an occult force which is universal and invariably governed by the same laws.

>S which really strikes the ears, and this is comprehensible enough, for how should a shadow speak ? With what instrument could it cause the air to vibrate by impressing it in such a manner as to make distinct sounds ? At the same time, electrical contacts are experienced from apparitions, and sometimes appear to be produced by the hand of the phantom, but the phenomenon is wholly subjective, and is occasioned solely by the power of imagination and the local wealth of the occult force which we term the astral light. The proof of this is that spirits, or at least the spectres pretended to be such, may indeed occasionally touch us, but we cannot touch them, and this is one of the most affrighting characteristics of these apparitions, which are at times so real in appearance that we cannot unmoved feel the hand pass through that which seems a body without touching or meeting anything.
## 44: Levi (1856) 475 [2]

>We have said that the astral light is the great book of divinations ; the faculty of reading therein is either natural or acquired, and there are hence two classes of seers, the instinctive and the initiated. For this reason, children, uneducated people, shepherds, even idiots, have more aptitude for natural divination than scholars and thinkers. The simple herd-boy, David, was a prophet even as Solomon, king of kabbalists and magi. The perceptions of instinct are often as certain as those of science ; the persons least clairvoyant in the astral light are those who reason most. Somnambulism is a state of pure instinct, and hence somnambulists require to be directed by a seer of science; sceptics and reasoners only lead them astray. Divinatory vision operates only in the ecstatic state, to arrive at which state, doubt and illusion must become impossible by enchaining or putting to sleep thought. The instruments of divination are hence only methods of magnetising ourselves and of self-diversion from exterior light, so that we may pay attention to the interior light alone. It was for this reason that Apollonius completely enveloped himself in a woollen mantle, and fixed his eyes on his navel in the gloom. The magical mirror of Dupotet is kindred to the device of Apollonius. Hydromancy and vision in the thumb-nail, when it has been polished and blackened, are varieties of the magical mirror. Perfumes and evocations stupefy thought ; water and the colour black absorb the visual rays ; a kind of dazzlement and vertigo ensue, followed by lucidity in subjects who have a natural aptitude or are suitably disposed thereto. Geomancy and cartomancy are other means to the same end; combinations of symbols and numbers, which are at once fortuitous and necessary, bear enough resemblance to the chances of destiny for the imagination to perceive realities by the pretext of such emblems. The more the interest is excited, the greater is the desire to see ; the fuller the confidence in the intuition, the more clear the vision becomes. To combine the points of geomancy on chance or to set out the cards for trifling is to jest like children ; the lots become oracles only when they are magnetised by intelligence and directed by faith.

>2B cannot be explained by things impossible ! No, invisible beings are not permitted to deceive, torment, seduce, and even kill the living creatures of God, men, already so ignorant, and scarce able to combat their own delusions ! Those who told you all this in your childhood, Monsieur le Comte, have deceived you, and if you were child enough once to listen to them, be man enough now to disbelieve them. Man is himself the creator of his heaven and hell, and there are no demons except our own follies. Minds chastised by truth are corrected by the chastisement, and dream no more of disturbing the world. If Satan exist, he can be only the most unfortunate, most ignorant, most humiliated, and most impotent of beings. The existence of a universal agent of life, of a living fire, of an astral light, is demonstrated by facts. Magnetism enables us to understand to-day the miracles of old magic ; the facts of second sight, aspirations, sudden cures, thought-reading, are now admitted and familiar things, even among our children. But the tradition of the ancients has been lost, discoveries have been regarded as new, the last word is sought about observed phenomena, minds grow excited over meaningless manifestations, fascinations are experienced without being understood. We say, therefore, to table- turners : These prodigies are not novel; you can perform even greater wonders if you study the laws of nature. And what will follow a new acquaintance with these powers ? A new career opened to the activity and intelligence of man, the battle of life reorganised with arms more perfect, and the possibility restored to the flower of intelligence of once more becoming the masters of all destinies, by providing true priests and great kings for the world to come !
## 46: Levi (1860) 29 [2]

>How is all this possible? Because there is a composite agent, a natural and divine agent, at once corporeal and spiritual, an universal plastic mediator, a common receptacle for vibrations of movement and images of form, a fluid and a force which may be called, in a sense at least, the imagination of Nature. By the mediation of this force every nervous apparatus is in secret communication together; hence come sympathy and antipathy, hence dreams, hence the phenomena of second sight and extra-natural vision. This universal agent of Nature’s works is the _Od_ of the Jews and of Reichenbach, the Astral Light of the Martinists, which denomination we prefer as the more explicit.
## 47: Levi (1860) 33 [2]

>A particular phenomenon occurs when the brain is congested or overcharged by Astral Light; sight is turned inward, instead of outward; night falls on the external and real world, while fantastic brilliance shines on the world of dreams; even the physical eyes experience a slight quivering and turn up inside the lids. The soul then perceives by means of images the reflection of its impressions and thoughts. This is to say that the analogy subsisting between idea and form attracts in the Astral Light a reflection representing that form, configuration being the essence of the vital light; it is the universal imagination, of which each of us appropriates a lesser or greater part according to our grade of sensibility and memory. Therein is the source of all apparitions, all extraordinary visions and all the intuitive phenomena peculiar to madness or ecstasy.
# Kabbalistic Tarot

## 1: Levi (1856) 162 [1]

>In archaic writings preceding the Captivity, the Hebrew tau was cruciform, which further confirms our interpretation of the twelfth plate of the Kabbalistic Tarot. The cross, which produces four triangles, is also the sacred sign of the duodenary, and on this account it was called the Key of heaven by the Egyptians. So Etteilla, confused by his protracted researches for the conciliation of the analogical necessities of this symbol with his own personal opinion, in which he was influenced by the erudite Court de Gebelin, placed in the hand of his upright hanged man, by him interpreted as Prudence, a Hermetic caduceus, formed by two serpents and a Greek tau. Seeing that he understood the necessity for the tau or cross on the twelfth leaf of the book of Thoth, he should also have seen the multiple and magnificent meaning of the Hermetic hanged man, the Prometheus of science, the living man who makes contact with earth by his thought alone, whose firm ground is heaven, the free and immolated adept, the revealer menaced with death, the conjuration of Judaism against Christ, which seems to be an involuntary admission of the secret divinity of the Crucified, lastly, the sign of the work accomplished, the cycle terminated, the intermediary tau, which resumes for the first time, before the final denary, the signs of the sacred alphabet.

>The author—the writer, rather—feels it necessary to apologize for the long delay which has occurred in the appearance of this work. It has been occasioned by ill‐health and the magnitude of the undertaking. Even the two volumes now issued do not complete the scheme, nor do these treat exhaustively of the subjects dealt with in them. A large quantity of material has already been prepared, dealing with the history of Occultism as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of the Âryan Race, and showing the bearing of Occult Philosophy upon the conduct of life, as it is and as it ought to be. Should the present volumes meet with a favourable reception, no effort will be spared to carry out the scheme of the work in its entirety.
## 4: Blavatsky (1888) 3 [0]

>This scheme, it must be added, was not in contemplation when the preparation of the work was first announced. As originally announced, it was intended that The Secret Doctrine should be an amended and enlarged version of Isis Unveiled. It was, however, soon found that the explanations which could be added to those already put before the world, in the last‐named and other works dealing with Esoteric Science, were such as to require a different method of treatment; and consequently the present volumes do not contain, in all, twenty pages extracted from Isis Unveiled.

>The author does not feel it necessary to ask the indulgence of her readers and critics for the many defects of literary style, and the imperfect English which may be found in these pages. She is a foreigner, and her knowledge of the language was acquired late in life. The English tongue is employed because it offers the most widely‐diffused medium for conveying the truths which it had become her duty to place before the world.
## 6: Blavatsky (1888) 5 [0]

>These truths are in no sense put forward as a revelation; nor does the author claim the position of a revealer of mystic lore, now made public for the first time in the world’s history. For what is contained in this work is to be found scattered throughout thousands of volumes embodying the Scriptures of the great Asiatic and early European religions, hidden under glyph and symbol, and hitherto left unnoticed because of this veil. What is now attempted is to gather the oldest tenets together and to make of them one harmonious and unbroken whole. The sole advantage which the writer has over her predecessors, is that she need not resort to personal speculations and theories. For this work is a partial statement of what she herself has been taught by more advanced students, supplemented, in a few details only, by the results of her own study and observation. The publication of many of the facts herein stated has been rendered necessary by the wild and fanciful speculations in which many Theosophists and students of Mysticism have indulged, during the last few years, in their endeavour, as they imagined, to work out a complete system of thought from the few facts previously communicated to them.

>It is needless to explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine in its entirety, but a select number of fragments of its fundamental tenets, special attention being paid to some facts which have been seized upon by various writers, and distorted out of all resemblance to the truth.
## 8: Blavatsky (1888) 7 [0]

>But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings, however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in these volumes, do not belong to the Hindû, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldæan, or the Egyptian religion, nor to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or Christianity exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is the essence of all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the various religious schemes are now made to merge back into their original element, out of which every mystery and dogma has grown, developed, and become materialized.

>The writer, therefore, is fully prepared to take all the responsibility for what is contained in this work, and even to face the charge of having invented the whole of it. That it has many shortcomings she is fully aware; all that she claims for it is that, romantic as it may seem to many, its logical coherence and consistency entitle this new Genesis to rank, at any rate, on a level with the “working hypotheses” so freely accepted by Modern Science. Further, it claims consideration, not by reason of any appeal to dogmatic authority, but because it closely adheres to Nature, and follows the laws of uniformity and analogy.
## 11: Blavatsky (1888) 10 [0]

>The aim of this work may be thus stated: to show that Nature is not “a fortuitous concurrence of atoms,” and to assign to man his rightful place in the scheme of the Universe; to rescue from degradation the archaic truths which are the basis of all religions; to uncover, to some extent, the fundamental unity from which they all spring; finally, to show that the Occult side of Nature has never been approached by the Science of modern civilization.

That this is not done is one of the many minor losses caused by the one great loss.

>Awkward phrases, due to imperfect knowledge of English, have been corrected; most of the quotations have been verified, and exact references given—a work involving great labour, as the references in the previous editions were often very loose; a uniform system of transliteration for Sanskrit words has been adopted. Rejecting the form most favoured by Western Orientalists as being misleading to the general reader—we have given to the consonants not present in our English alphabet combinations that approximately express their sound‐values, and we have carefully inserted quantities, wherever they occur, on the vowels. In a few instances we have incorporated notes in the text, but this has been very sparingly done, and only when they obviously formed part of it.

>Since the appearance of Theosophical literature in England, it has become customary to call its teachings “Esoteric Buddhism.” And, having become a habit—as an old proverb based on daily experience has it—“Error runs down an inclined plane, while Truth has to laboriously climb its way up hill.”
## 17: Blavatsky (1888) 16 [0]

>Old truisms are often the wisest. The human mind can hardly remain entirely free from bias, and decisive opinions are often formed before a thorough examination of a subject from all its aspects has been made. This is said with reference to the prevailing double mistake (a) of limiting Theosophy to Buddhism; and (b) of confounding the tenets of the religious philosophy preached by Gautama, the Buddha, with the doctrines broadly outlined in Esoteric Buddhism. Any thing more erroneous than this could hardly be imagined. It has enabled our enemies to find an effective weapon against Theosophy, because, as an eminent Pâli scholar very pointedly expressed it, there was in the volume named “neither Esotericism nor Buddhism.” The esoteric truths, presented in Mr. Sinnett’s work, ceased to be esoteric from the moment they were made public; nor did the book contain the religion of Buddha, but simply a few tenets from a hitherto hidden teaching, which are now explained and supplemented by many more in the present volumes. And even the latter, though giving out many fundamental tenets from the SECRET DOCTRINE of the East, raise but a small corner of the dark veil. For no one, not even the greatest living Adept, would be permitted to, or could—even if he would—give out promiscuously to a mocking, unbelieving world that which has been so effectually concealed from it for long æons and ages.
## 18: Blavatsky (1888) 17 [0]

>Esoteric Buddhism was an excellent work with a very unfortunate title, though it meant no more than does the title of this work, THE SECRET DOCTRINE. It proved unfortunate, because people are always in the habit of judging things by their appearance rather than by their meaning, and because the error has now become so universal, that even most of the Fellows of the Theosophical Society have fallen victims to the same misconception. From the first, however, protests were raised by Brâhmans and others against the title; and, in justice to myself, I must add that Esoteric Buddhism was presented to me as a completed volume, and that I was entirely unaware of the manner in which the author intended to spell the word “Budh‐ism.”
## 19: Blavatsky (1888) 18 [0]

>This has to be laid directly at the door of those who, having been the first to bring the subject under public notice, neglected to point out the difference between “Buddhism”—the religious system of ethics preached by the Lord Gautama, and so named from his title of Buddha, the “Enlightened”—and “Budhism,” from Budha, Wisdom, or Knowledge (Vidyâ), the faculty of cognizing, from the Sanskrit root Budh, to know. We Theosophists of India are ourselves the real culprits, although, at the time, we did our best to correct the mistake. To avoid this deplorable misnomer was easy; the spelling of the word had only to be altered, and by common consent both pronounced and written “Budhism,” instead of “Buddhism.” Nor is the latter term correctly spelt and pronounced, as it ought to be called, in English, Buddhaïsm, and its votaries “Buddhaïsts.”
## 20: Blavatsky (1888) 19 [0]

>This explanation is absolutely necessary at the beginning of a work like the present. The Wisdom‐Religion is the inheritance of all the nations, the world over, in spite of the statement made in Esoteric Buddhism that “two years ago (i.e., in 1883), neither I, nor any other European living, knew the alphabet of the Science, here for the first time put into a scientific shape,” etc. This error must have crept in through inadvertence. The present writer knew all that is “divulged” in Esoteric Buddhism, and much more, many years before it became her duty (in 1880) to impart a small portion of the Secret Doctrine to two European gentlemen, one of whom was the author of Esoteric Buddhism; and surely the present writer has the undoubted, though to her, rather equivocal, privilege of being a European by birth and education. Moreover, a considerable part of the philosophy expounded by Mr. Sinnett was taught in America, even before Isis Unveiled was published, to two Europeans and to my colleague, Colonel H. S. Olcott. Of the three teachers the latter gentleman has had, the first was a Hungarian Initiate, the second an Egyptian, the third a Hindû. As permitted, Colonel Olcott has given out some of this teaching in various ways; if the other two have not, it has been simply because they were not allowed, their time for public work having not yet come. But for others it has, and the appearance of Mr. Sinnett’s several interesting books is a visible proof of the fact. Moreover, it is above everything important to keep in mind that no Theosophical book acquires the least additional value from pretended authority.
## 21: Blavatsky (1888) 20 [0]

>Âdi, or Âdhi Budha, the One, or the First, and Supreme Wisdom, is a term used by Âryâsanga in his secret treatises, and now by all the mystic Northern Buddhists. It is a Sanskrit term, and an appellation given by the earliest Âryans to the Unknown Deity; the word “Brahmâ” not being found in the Vedas and the early works. It means the Absolute Wisdom, and Âdibhûta is translated by Fitzedward Hall, “the primeval uncreated cause of all.” Æons of untold duration must have elapsed, before the epithet of Buddha was so humanized, so to speak, as to allow of the term being applied to mortals, and finally appropriated to one whose unparalleled virtues and knowledge caused him to receive the title of the “Buddha of Wisdom Unmoved.” Bodha means the innate possession of divine intellect or understanding; Buddha, the acquirement of it by personal efforts and merit; while Buddhi is the faculty of cognizing, the channel through which divine knowledge reaches the Ego, the discernment of good and evil, also divine conscience, and the Spiritual Soul, which is the vehicle of Âtmâ. “When Buddhi absorbs our Ego‐tism (destroys it) with all its Vikâras, Avalokiteshvara becomes manifested to us, and Nirvâna, or Mukti, is reached,” Mukti being the same as Nirvana, i.e., freedom from the trammels of Mâyâ or Illusion. Bodhi is likewise the name of a particular state of trance‐condition, called Samâdhi, during which the subject reaches the culmination of spiritual knowledge.

>Unwise are those who, in their blind and, in our age, untimely hatred of Buddhism, and, by reäction, of Budhism, deny its esoteric teachings, which are those also of the Brâhmans, simply because the name suggests what to them, as Monotheists, are noxious doctrines. Unwise is the correct term to use in their case. For in this age of crass and illogical materialism, the Esoteric Philosophy alone is calculated to withstand the repeated attacks on all and everything man holds most dear and sacred in his inner spiritual life. The true philosopher, the student of Esoteric Wisdom, entirely loses sight of personalities, dogmatic beliefs and special religions. Moreover, Esoteric Philosophy reconciles all religions, strips every one of its outward human garments, and shows the root of each to be identical with that of every other great religion. It proves the necessity of a Divine Absolute Principle in Nature. It denies Deity no more than it does the sun. Esoteric Philosophy has never rejected God in Nature, nor Deity as the absolute and abstract Ens. It only refuses to accept any of the gods of the so‐called monotheistic religions, gods created by man in his own image and likeness, a blasphemous and sorry caricature of the Ever‐Unknowable. Furthermore, the records we mean to place before the reader embrace the esoteric tenets of the whole world since the beginning of our humanity, and Buddhistic Occultism occupies therein only its legitimate place, and no more. Indeed, the secret portions of the Dan or Janna (Dhyâna) of Gautama’s metaphysics—grand as they appear to one unacquainted with the tenets of the Wisdom‐Religion of antiquity—are but a very small portion of the whole. The Hindû reformer limited his public teachings to the purely moral and physiological aspect of the Wisdom-Religion, to ethics and man alone. Things “unseen and incorporeal,” the mysteries of Being outside our terrestrial sphere, the great Teacher left entirely untouched in his public lectures, reserving the Hidden Truths for a select circle of his Arhats. The latter received their Initiation at the famous Saptaparna Cave (the Sattapanni of Mahâvansa) near Mount Baibhâr (the Webhâra of the Pâli MSS.). This cave was in Râjâgriha, the ancient capital of Magadha, and was the Cheta Cave of Fa‐hian, as is rightly suspected by some archaeologists.
## 23: Blavatsky (1888) 22 [0]

>Time and human imagination made short work of the purity and philosophy of these teachings, once that they were transplanted from the secret and sacred circle of the Arhats, during the course of their work of proselytism, into a soil less prepared for metaphysical conceptions than India; i.e., once they were transferred into China, Japan, Siam, and Burmah. How the pristine purity of these grand revelations was dealt with may be seen in studying some of the so‐called “esoteric” Buddhist schools of antiquity in their modern garb, not only in China and other Buddhist countries in general, but even in not a few schools of Tibet, which have been left to the care of uninitiated Lamas and Mongolian innovators.
## 24: Blavatsky (1888) 23 [0]

>Thus the reader is asked to bear in mind the very important difference between orthodox Buddhism—i.e., the public teachings of Gautama, the Buddha—and his esoteric Budhism. His Secret Doctrine, however, differed in no wise from that of the initiated Brahmans of his day. The Buddha was a child of Âryan soil, a born Hindû, a Kshatriya and a disciple of the Twice‐born (the initiated Brâhmans) or Dvîjas. His teachings, therefore, could not be different from their doctrines, for the whole Buddhist reform consisted merely in giving out a portion of that which had been kept secret from every man outside of the “enchanted” circle of ascetics and Temple‐Initiates. Unable, owing to his pledges, to teach all that had been imparted to him, though the Buddha taught a philosophy built upon the ground‐work of the true esoteric knowledge, he gave to the world only its outward material body and kept its soul for his Elect. Many Chinese scholars among Orientalists have heard of the “Soul‐Doctrine.” None seem to have understood its real meaning and importance.

>That doctrine was preserved secretly—too secretly, perhaps—within the sanctuary. The mystery that shrouded its chief dogma and aspiration—Nirvâna—has so tried and irritated the curiosity of those scholars who have studied it, that, unable to solve it logically and satisfactorily by untying its Gordian knot, they have cut it through by declaring that Nirvâna means absolute annihilation.

>Toward the end of the first quarter of this century a distinct class of literature appeared in the world, which with every year became more defined in its tendency. Being based, soi‐disant, on the scholarly researches of Sanskritists and Orientalists in general, it was considered scientific. Hindû, Egyptian, and other ancient religions, myths, and emblems were made to yield anything the symbologist wanted them to yield, and thus often the rude outward form was given out in place of the inner meaning. Works, most remarkable for their ingenious deductions and speculations, circulo vicioso—foregone conclusions generally taking the place of premisses in the syllogisms of more than one Sanskrit and Pâli scholar—appeared rapidly in succession, over‐flooding the libraries with dissertations on phallic and sexual worship rather than on real symbology, and each contradicting the other.
## 27: Blavatsky (1888) 26 [0]

>This is the true reason, perhaps, why the outline of a few fundamental truths from the Secret Doctrine of the Archaic Ages is now permitted to see the light, after long millenniums of the most profound silence and secrecy. I say advisedly “a few truths,” because that which must remain unsaid could not be contained in a hundred such volumes, nor could it be imparted to the present generation of Sadducees. But even the little that is now given is better than complete silence upon these vital truths. The world of to‐day, in its mad career towards the unknown, which the Physicist is too ready to confound with the unknowable, whenever the problem eludes his grasp, is rapidly progressing on the reverse plane to that of spirituality. It has now become a vast arena, a true valley of discord and of eternal strife, a necropolis, wherein lie buried the highest and the most holy aspirations of our Spirit‐Soul. That soul becomes with every new generation more paralyzed and atrophied. The “amiable infidels and accomplished profligates” of Society, spoken of by Greeley, care little for the revival of the dead sciences of the past; but there is a fair minority of earnest students who are entitled to learn the few truths that may be given to them now; and now much more than ten years ago, when Isis Unveiled appeared, or even when the later attempts to explain the mysteries of esoteric science were published.

>One of the greatest and perhaps the most serious objection to the correctness and reliability of the whole work will be the preliminary Stanzas. How can the statements contained in them be verified? True, though a great portion of the Sanskrit, Chinese, and Mongolian works quoted in the present volumes is known to some Orientalists, yet the chief work—that one from which the Stanzas are given—is not in the possession of European Libraries. THE BOOK OF DZYAN (or DZAN) is utterly unknown to our Philologists, or at any rate was never heard of by them under its present name. This is, of course, a great drawback to those who follow the methods of research prescribed by official Science; but to students of Occultism, and to every genuine Occultist, this will be of little moment. The main body of the doctrines given, however, is found scattered throughout hundreds and thousands of Sanskrit MSS., some already translated—disfigured in their interpretations, as usual—others still waiting their turn. Every scholar, therefore, has an opportunity of verifying the statements herein made, and of checking most of the quotations. A few new facts, new to the profane Orientalist only, and passages quoted from the Commentaries will be found difficult to trace. Several of the teachings also have hitherto been transmitted orally, yet even these in every instance are hinted at in the almost countless volumes of Brâhmanical, Chinese and Tibetan temple‐literature.

>However it may be, and whatsoever is in store for the writer through malevolent criticism, one fact is quite certain. The members of several esoteric schools—the seat of which is beyond the Himâlayas, and whose ramifications may be found in China, Japan, India, Tibet, and even in Syria, and also South America—claim to have in their possession the sum total of sacred and philosophical works in MSS. and print, all the works, in fact, that have ever been written, in whatever language or character, since the art of writing began, from the ideographic hieroglyphs down to the alphabet of Cadmus and the Devanâgari.

>It has been constantly claimed that, ever since the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, every work of a character that might lead the profane to the ultimate discovery and comprehension of some of the mysteries of the Secret Science, owing to the combined efforts of the members of these Brotherhoods, has been diligently searched for. It is added, moreover, by those who know, that once found all such works were destroyed, save three copies of each which were preserved and safely stored away. In India, the last of these precious manuscripts were secured and hidden during the reign of the Emperor Akbar.

>Prof. Max Müller shows that no bribes or threats of Akbar could extort the original text of the Vedas from the Brâhmans, and yet boasts that European Orientalists have it. That Europe has the complete text is exceedingly doubtful, and the future may have very disagreeable surprises in store for the Orientalists.
## 32: Blavatsky (1888) 31 [0]

>It is maintained, furthermore, that every sacred book of this kind, the text of which was not sufficiently veiled in symbolism, or which had any direct references to the ancient mysteries, was first carefully copied in cryptographic characters, such as to defy the art of the best and cleverest palæographer, and then destroyed to the last copy. During Akbar’s reign, some fanatical courtiers, displeased at the Emperor’s sinful prying into the religions of the infidels, themselves helped the Brâhmans to conceal their MSS. Such was Badáoní, who had an undisguised horror of Akbar’s mania for idolatrous religions.

>As they [the Shramana and Brâhmans] surpass other learned men in their treatises on morals and on physical and religious sciences, and reach a high degree in their knowledge of the future, in spiritual power, and human perfection, they brought proofs based on reason and testimony, ... and inculcated their doctrines so firmly ... that no man ... could now raise a doubt in his Majesty even if mountains were to crumble to dust, or the heavens were to tear asunder.... His Majesty relished inquiries into the sects of these infidels, who cannot be counted, so numerous they are, and who have no end of revealed books.

>Moreover in all the large and wealthy Lamasaries, there are subterranean crypts and cave‐libraries, cut in the rock, whenever the Gonpa and Lhakhang are situated in the mountains. Beyond the Western Tsaydam, in the solitary passes of Kuen‐lun there are several such hiding‐places. Along the ridge of Altyn‐tag, whose soil no European foot has ever trodden so far, there exists a certain hamlet, lost in a deep gorge. It is a small cluster of houses, a hamlet rather than a monastery, with a poor‐looking temple in it, and one old Lama, a hermit, living near by to watch it. Pilgrims say that the subterranean galleries and halls under it contain a collection of books, the number of which, according to the accounts given, is too large to find room even in the British Museum.

>According to the same tradition the now desolate regions of the waterless land of Tarim—a veritable wilderness in the heart of Turkestan—were in days of old covered with flourishing and wealthy cities. At present, a few verdant oases only relieve its dread solitude. One such, carpeting the sepulchre of a vast city buried under the sandy soil of the desert, belongs to no one, but is often visited by Mongolians and Buddhists. The tradition also speaks of immense subterranean abodes, of large corridors filled with tiles and cylinders. It may be an idle rumour, and it may be an actual fact.

>All this will very likely provoke a smile of doubt. But before the reader rejects the truthfulness of the reports, let him pause and reflect over the following well‐known facts. The collective researches of Orientalists, and especially of late years the labours of students of Comparative Philology and the Science of Religion, have enabled them to ascertain that an incalculable number of MSS., and even of printed works known to have existed, are now to be no more found. They have disappeared without leaving the slightest trace behind them. Were they works of no importance they might, in the natural course of time, have been left to perish, and their very names would have been obliterated from human memory. But this is not so, for, as now ascertained, most of them contained the true keys to works still extant, and now entirely incomprehensible, for the greater portion of their readers, without these additional volumes of commentaries and explanations.
## 37: Blavatsky (1888) 36 [0]

>Such, for instance, are the works of Lao‐tse, the predecessor of Confucius. He is said to have written nine hundred and thirty books on ethics and religions, and seventy on magic, one thousand in all. His great work, however, the Tao‐te‐King, the heart of his doctrine and the sacred scripture of the Tao‐sse, has in it, as Stanislas Julien shows, only “about 5,000 words,” hardly a dozen of pages; yet Professor Max Müller finds that “the text is unintelligible without commentaries, so that M. Julien had to consult more than sixty commentators for the purpose of his translation, the earliest going back as far as the year 163 B.C.”, and not earlier, as we see. During the four centuries and a half that preceded this “earliest” of the commentators there was ample time to veil the true Lao‐tse doctrine from all but his initiated priests. The Japanese, among whom are now to be found the most learned of the priests and followers of Lao‐tse, simply laugh at the blunders and hypotheses of European Chinese scholars; and tradition affirms that the commentaries to which our Western Sinologues have access are not the real occult records, but intentional veils, and that the true commentaries, as well as almost all the texts, have long disappeared from the eyes of the profane.

>If we turn to China, we find that the religion of Confucius is founded on the Five King and the Four Shu books—in themselves of considerable extent and surrounded by voluminous Commentaries, without which even the most learned scholars would not venture to fathom the depth of their sacred canon.

>If our scholars turn to the ancient literature of the Semitic religions, to the Scriptures of Chaldea, the elder sister and instructress, if not the fountain‐head of the Mosaic Bible, the basis and starting‐point of Christianity, what do they find? To perpetuate the memory of the ancient religions of Babylon, to record the vast cycle of astronomical observations of the Chaldean Magi, to justify the tradition of their splendid and preëminently occult literature, what now remains? Only a few fragments, which are said to be by Berosus.
## 40: Blavatsky (1888) 39 [0]

>These, however, are almost valueless, even as a clue to the character of what has disappeared, for they passed through the hands of his Reverence, the Bishop of Cæsarea—that self‐constituted censor and editor of the sacred records of other men’s religions—and they doubtless to this day bear the mark of his eminently veracious and trustworthy hand. For what is the history of this treatise on the once grand religion of Babylon?
## 41: Blavatsky (1888) 40 [0]

>It was written in Greek for Alexander the Great, by Berosus, a priest of the temple of Belus, from the astronomical and chronological records preserved by the priests of that temple—records covering a period of 200,000 years—and is now lost. In the first century B.C. Alexander Polyhistor made a series of extracts from it, which are also lost. Eusebius (270‐340 A.D.) used these extracts in writing his Chronicon. The points of resemblance—almost of identity—between the Jewish and the Chaldean scriptures, made the latter most dangerous to Eusebius, in his rôle of defender and champion of the new faith which had adopted the former scriptures and together with them an absurd chronology.
## 42: Blavatsky (1888) 41 [0]

>Now it is pretty certain that Eusebius did not spare the Egyptian synchronistic tables of Manetho—so much so that Bunsen charges him with mutilating history most unscrupulously, and Socrates, a historian of the fifth century, and Syncellus, vice‐patriarch of Constantinople in the beginning of the eighth, denounce him as the most daring and desperate forger. Is it likely, then, that he dealt more tenderly with the Chaldean records, which were already menacing the new religion, so rashly accepted?
## 43: Blavatsky (1888) 42 [0]

>So that, with the exception of these more than doubtful fragments, the entire Chaldean sacred literature has disappeared from the eyes of the profane as completely as the lost Atlantis. A few facts that were contained in the Berosian History are given later on, and may throw great light on the true origin of the Fallen Angels, personified by Bel and the Dragon.

>Turning now to the oldest specimen of Âryan literature, the Rig Veda, the student if he strictly follows in this the data furnished by the Orientalists themselves, will find that although the Rig Veda contains only about 10,580 verses, or 1,028 hymns, yet in spite of the Brâhmanas and the mass of glosses and commentaries, it is not understood correctly to this day. Why is this so? Evidently because the Brâhmanas, “the scholastic and oldest treatises on the primitive hymns,” themselves require a key, which the Orientalists have failed to secure.
## 45: Blavatsky (1888) 44 [0]

>What, again, do the scholars say of Buddhist literature? Do they possess it in its completeness? Assuredly not. Notwithstanding the 325 volumes of the Kanjur and Tanjur of the Northern Buddhists, each volume, we are told, “weighing from four to five pounds,” nothing, in truth, is known of real Lamaïsm. Yet the sacred canon is said in the Saddharmâlankâra to contain 29,368,000 letters, or, exclusive of treatises and commentaries, five or six times the amount of the matter contained in the Bible, which, as Professor Max Müller states, rejoices in only 3,567,180 letters. Notwithstanding, then, these 325 volumes (in reality there are 333, the Kanjur comprising 108, and Tanjur 225 volumes), “the translators, instead of supplying us with correct versions, have interwoven them with their own commentaries, for the purpose of justifying the dogmas of their several schools.” Moreover, “according to a tradition preserved by the Buddhist schools, both of the South and of the North, the sacred Buddhist Canon comprised originally 80,000 or 84,000 tracts, but most of them were lost, so that there remained but 6,000”—as the Professor tells his audience. Lost, as usual—for Europeans. But who can be quite sure that they are likewise lost for Buddhists and Brâhmans?
## 46: Blavatsky (1888) 45 [0]

>Considering the reverence of the Buddhists for every line written upon Buddha and the Good Law, the loss of nearly 76,000 tracts does seem miraculous. Had it been vice versâ, every one acquainted with the natural course of events would subscribe to the statement that, of these 76,000, 5,000 or 6,000 treatises might have been destroyed during the persecutions in, and emigrations from, India. But as it is well ascertained that the Buddhist Arhats began their religious exodus, for the purpose of propagating the new faith beyond Kashmir and the Himâlayas, as early as the year 300 before our era, and reached China in the year 61 A.D., when Kashyapa, at the invitation of the Emperor Ming‐ti, went there to acquaint the “Son of Heaven” with the tenets of Buddhism, it does seem strange to hear the Orientalists speaking of such a loss as though it were really possible. They do not seem to allow for one moment the possibility that the texts may be lost only for the West and for themselves, or that the Asiatic people should have the unparalleled boldness to keep their most sacred records out of the reach of foreigners, thus refusing to deliver them to the profanation and misuse even of races so “vastly superior” to themselves.
## 47: Blavatsky (1888) 46 [0]

>Judging by the expressed regrets and numerous confessions of almost every one of the Orientalists, the public may feel sufficiently sure, (a) that the students of ancient religions have indeed very few data upon which to build such final conclusions as they generally do about the old faiths, and (b) that such lack of data does not in the least prevent them from dogmatizing. One would imagine that, thanks to the numerous records of the Egyptian theogony and mysteries, preserved in the classics and in a number of ancient writers, the rites and dogmas of Pharaonic Egypt, at least, ought to be well understood; better, at any rate, than the too abstruse philosophies and Pantheism of India, of whose religion and language Europe had hardly any idea before the beginning of the present century. Along the Nile and on the face of the whole country, there stand to this hour, yearly and daily exhumed, ever fresh relics which eloquently tell their own history. Still it is not so. The learned Oxford Philologist himself confesses the truth by saying:
# Magnetic Sleep

## 1: Denis (1838) 42 [7]

>Accordingly, I now proceed with the evidence. In 1820, numerous experiments were performed by me in Paris, at the Hotel-Dieu, and many incredulous physicians, attracted by the novelty, witnessed them, and wished to satisfy themselves that there was no deception. To this I assented, and accordingly they proceeded to prove the insensibility of the patients by a variety of tests, many of which were very cruel ; but these experiments were not performed by me ; it was a sort of sacrifice of humanity which incredulity insisted upon, and in the infancy of the science I had no alternative excepting to permit them, or allow truth itself to be compromised by the refusal. Hence the unconscious patients were subjected to the following trials : — their lips and nostrils were tickled with feathers ; their skin was pinched until ecchymoses (bruises) were produced ; smoke was introduced into the nasal passages, and the feet of one female were plunged into a strong infusion of mustard-seed at a high temperature. But not the slightest sign of pain did they evince. The expression of the countenance remained unchanged, nor was the pulse in any degree affected. On being awakened, however, out of the magnetic sleep, they all experienced the pain usually attendant on such applications, and were exceedingly angry at the treatment they had received. Many of the physicians who had witnessed this scene, and who were convinced of the reality of the magnetic influence, applied to me to teach them how to conduct the operation, and several very soon acquired the method, upon which they proceeded to convince themselves, by their own personal experiments, of the absolute extinction of sensibility in such cases. The means they adopted were on many occasions revolting, but the result removed every shade of doubt from their minds. I now, therefore, proceed to adduce their evidence. It is no longer I who attest the facts ; and praise or blame, should either be bestowed, will be alike inapplicable to me. Here, therefore, I subjoin the following proces-verbal by Dr. Kobouam, who was then attached to the Hotel-Dieu. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 6th of January, 1821, M. Recamier, on visiting the hospital, requested me to put into magnetic sleep a man named Starin, whose bed was No. 8 of the ward Sainte-Madelaine. M. Recamier first threatened him with the application of moxa,* if he allowed himself to fall asleep, and I caused the patient, much against his will, to pass into the magnetic sleep, during which M. Recamier applied the moxa on the fore-part of the right thigh, which moxa produced an eschar seventeen lines in length and eleven in breadth ; that Starin did not manifest the least sign of pain, either by crying out, gesture, or variation of the pulse ; that he did not feel the application of the moxa until I had roused him out of the magnetic sleep. Madame SainteMonique, the matron of the ward, MM. Gibert, La Peyre, Bergeret, Carquet, Truche, &c, &c, were present during this seance" Here, also, is another procesverbal by the same physician. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 8th of January, 1821, at the request of M. Recamier, I put into magnetic sleep the woman Leroy (Lise), lying in the bed No. 22 in the ward Sainte-Agnes. M. Recamier had previously threatened that he would apply a moxa to her person if she allowed herself to fall asleep. I, Robouam, then, much against her will, caused the patient to fall into magnetic sleep, during which M. Gibert burned agaric under her nostrils, and this nauseous smell produced no perceptible effect ; that afterwards M. Recamier himself applied moxa on the epigastric region (pit of the stomach), which produced an eschar of fifteen lines in length and nine in breadth ; that during the operation, the patient did not shew the least symptoms of suffering, either by cries, gestures, or variation of the pulse ; that she remained in a state of perfect insensibility, and that on awakening from the magnetic sleep, she shewed signs of suffering great pain. MM. Gibert, Crequi, &c, were present at this seance? (Signed,) Robouam, Docteur-Medecin.

>" A part only of the intellectual faculties of the somnambule remain awake ; they are all so in the magnetic somnambule with regard to those with whom he is in contact en rapport. The natural somnambule is impelled by his own imagination, and certain corporeal impressions ; the magnetic somnambule wholly depends on the will and faculties of his magnetiser. The organisation of the magnetic somnambule, that of his magnetiser, and of those persons whom the latter brings in report with him by means of a slight contact, are all, as it were, identified as one and the same being ; so that the somnambule knows inwardly what takes place in the system of another person ; feels diseases which are not his own, and has an intuitive instinct of the remedies applicable to them. This it is which, to the unspeakable scandal and indignation of classic medicine, gave birth to her rival sister, under the name of magnetic medicine. The magnetic somnambule is conscious of the state and organisation of an absent person on merely touching a vestment which has been worn, or an object which has been touched, by the same person. He can either recal or forget, at the will of his magnetiser, what he has felt during the fit of somnambulism. His sensations and perceptions may, at the will of the magnetiser, be changed ; or, in other words, he will find sweet that which is bitter, and vice versa. He may also change his predilections and habitual dispositions.
## 3: Denis (1838) 296 [4]

>The penetrating intensity and subtile power of the magnetic influence is best illustrated by the magnetiser performing the operation at a distance, and without the knowledge of the patient, through the intervention of such opaque bodies as a screen, folding doors, or thick walls. The possibility of the operation being conducted efficiently in this manner is established beyond a doubt ; and I proceed, therefore, to cite some few facts in proof of it, because, before entering on the explication of the phenomena of animal magnetism, it is necessary that all the facts should be distinctly detailed. On the 4th of November, 1820, the Commissioners having assembled at the Hotel Dieu, M. Husson, one of the physicians of the hospital, said to me, " You can induce sleep in a very short time ; I wish you would obtain the same result without the patient either seeing you or being aware of your presence." I replied that I was willing to try, but that did not warrant the success of the experiment, because the action at a distance depended so much on the peculiar susceptibility of the individual. We agreed, however, upon a signal which I could hear in an adjoining apartment. M. Husson was to throw a pair of scissars down upon the table, and I was then to begin the operation. Accordingly I was ushered into a closet, separated from the room by a thick partition ; and the door having a good lock and key, I felt no hesitation in locking myself in, as I wished to multiply obstacles, so that no pretext might be left for suspicion or doubt. The patient was then brought into the adjacent room, and seated at a distance of about three or four feet, with her back turned towards the closet wherein I was concealed. They then, to deceive her, began wondering why I had not yet arrived, and Ihey pretended from this delay to conjecture that I did not intend to come; at the same time, they blamed me for not keeping my appointment. In short, my alleged absence was adverted to in such a manner as to leave no doubt, on the mind of the patient, that I was really elsewhere. The signal being then given, although I knew not where nor at what distance Mile. Samson was placed, I began to magnetise in the most profound silence, carefully avoiding the least movement which might apprise her of my being present. It was then thirty-five minutes past nine. In the course of three minutes, as soon as my will began to act, she was observed to rub her eyes, exhibit the usual symptoms of approaching sleep, and at length fell into a state of somnambulism. This experiment I repeated on the 7th of November, before Professor Recamier, who took every precaution to prevent deception, and the result was precisely similar. The following are the details of this second trial : — On my entering, at a quarter past nine, the operating room, M. Husson informed me that M. Recamier wished to be present, and to see me put the patient to sleep through the partition. I readily acquiesced. M. Recamier then entered, and privately conversed with me on the subject, when we agreed upon a signal ; and I slipped into the closet, where I was again locked in. Mile. Samson was then brought in ; M. Recamier placed her with her back turned towards the closet, at a distance of more than six feet from it. He then proceeded to converse with her, and found her better ; but on being told that I was not likely to arrive, she insisted upon retiring. The moment M. Recamier asked her whether she digested meat, which was the signal agreed upon between us, I began to magnetise her at thirty-two minutes past nine. Three minutes after, M. Recamier touched her, raised her eyelids, shook her by the hands, put questions to her, pinched her, and convinced himself that she was in a state of profound magnetic sleep. But even these trials were thought insufficient to establish so extraordinary a phenomenon ; and it was resolved, therefore, to multiply them, and vary all their details. Accordingly, I went one night, accompanied by M. Husson and other physicians, to the ward in which the same patient was, and took my position from her at a distance of several beds, keeping at the same time the most profound silence, so as not to attract attention. I began magnetising her at eight minutes past seven. At twelve minutes past, we all drew near, and convinced ourselves that magnetic sleep had been induced. It is unnecessary to add, that the period fixed on for this operation had been selected, not by me, but by the principal physician of the hospital ; further, that it had been ascertained that the patient was not asleep before the experiment, and that the magnetic influence had been exerted at a distance of about twenty feet. Having witnessed these experiments, M. Bertrand, Doctor of Medicine of the University of Paris, affirmed that he did not think it extraordinary that the patient should fall asleep while the magnetiser was in the closet ; because the constant recurrence of the same attending circumstances might have, independently of my presence, produced the same results ; and that, moreover, the patient might be naturally predisposed to sleep. He therefore proposed that she should be brought into the same room, and seated on the same seat, and that a conversation should be held with her as before. This repetition of the same circumstances, he thought, would induce sleep. But he was deceived. At a quarter before ten, they began to execute the plan agreed upon ; — she was seated on the same easy chair where she usually sat, and placed in the same position. Various questions were put to her ; she was then left to her own thoughts ; the signals previously used were again repeated, — scissars were thrown upon the table ; they went, in fact, through a complete rehearsal of everything previously done, but in vain was the magnetic state expected. She complained, became restless, shifted her position, and evinced anything but a disposition to either natural or magnetic sleep. After this, on my entering the room and. commencing the operation, the magnetic sleep, accompanied by the usual state of physical insensibility was perfectly established.

>A host of additional facts of the same description are in my possession, but the evidence already brought forward will be considered conclusive to every impartial mind. Not only does the magnetic somnambulist enjoy, in this state of clairvoyance, a lucidity respecting surrounding objects and passing events, but it extends still further, inasmuch as they foresee, and distinctly foretell, the day, the hour, even the minute, when certain events will happen. This is termed the faculty of prevision, and occurs only in the very highest degree of magnetic exaltation. It may appear incredible ; but let us look to the facts. In the treatise on somnambulism by Dr. Bertrand, we find that this physician witnessed upwards of sixty convulsive fits of the most aggravated nature, which it was absolutely impossible the patient could have simulated, all of which, and their duration to a minute, had been foretold during the magnetic sleep. The same physician assures us that a somnambulist told him a fortnight previously, that she should be seized with a delirium which would last forty-three hours, which happened according to her prediction ; and he further satisfied himself that this somnambule when awake had not the slightest recollection of what she had said in her sleep. This prevision was also noticed by Drs. Rostan and Georget, one of whom observes : — " I have seen, positively seen, and repeatedly, somnambulists foretell, several hours or days — even twenty days in advance, the precise hour and minute of the accession of epileptic or hysterical fits, and describe what would be their duration and intensity, which came to pass in exact accordance with the prediction." I have myself witnessed innumerable instances of this faculty of prevision being developed during the magnetic somnambulism, but, as my authority would doubtless be impugned as ex parte evidence, I prefer again appealing to the report of the French Academicians, the validity of whose testimony cannot reasonably be challenged.
## 5: Denis (1838) 53 [2]

>In the " Journal de Toulouse," April 5, 1830, the following case is reported : — " We have already witnessed the curious experiments performed at Toulouse, by the Comte de Brivazac ; the document which has now reached us, gives an account of a case which occurred in the department of the Gers, at the house of the justice of peace for the canton of Condom, in the presence of several persons, among whom were some of our own acquaintance. Jean Bordere, in the before-mentioned canton, was suffering from an abscess from congestion on the fore part of the thigh. His medical attendants declared that it was necessary to lance it freely, but that the operation should be conducted with much skill and prudence, because the crural artery ran through the tumour, which was very much enlarged. The Comte de Brivazac, whose power as a magnetiser is remarkable, proposed to throw the patient into a magnetic sleep, whereby insensibility might be superinduced, in order that the pain of the operation, inevitable in a waking state, might be spared the sufferer. His proposition was accepted. At the end of two minutes the patient was thrown into the magnetic state. His lucidity was not remarkable. He answered the magnetiser that it was in vain for him to try, as he could not perceive his complaint. At that moment, Dr. Larieu began, with great dexterity, the operation. He repeatedly plunged the probe into the opening made by the bistoury, in order to let out the purulent matter, the flow of which was occasionally impeded by albuminous flakes. A dressing was immediately afterwards ; applied. During the operation, the patient remained motionless as a statue ; his magnetic sleep was in nowise disturbed, and on the proposal being mooted that he should be brought out of the magnetic "state, M. de Brivazac spontaneously awakened him. M. Roc then drawing near, asked him whether he would submit to the operation, to which he replied, " I suppose I must, since it is necessary." M. Roc then informed him that it was unnecessary to recommence, as the operation had already been performed. The astonishment of the patient was at its height, when he saw the proofs of it ; for he had seen nothing, felt nothing, and remembered nothing, excepting the act of M. de Brivazac laying the palm of his hand upon his forehead to induce sleep."

>The discovery of magnetic somnambulism, instead of advancing, rather retarded than otherwise the progress of the science, inasmuch as the facts above stated appeared so startling and incredible, that many held it superfluous even to entertain any consideration of them ; and dismissed them, at once, as idle fictions and knavish impositions. The concurrent testimony, however, of so many individuals, who had no interest whatever in the matter, and whose integrity and powers of judgment could not be impugned, induced many who were incredulous to examine the facts ; and hence observations on this phenomenon have, during the last fifty years, been accumulated in all parts of Europe, even by those very individuals who were originally the most determined and perverse sceptics. I now, therefore, proceed to describe the phenomena which magnetic somnambulists exhibit ; but it is proper to observe, that no criterion of comparison can be established between different cases, because men differ as much from one another in somnambulism as they do in their habitual waking state. The Count de Redern, a distinguished savant, who devoted much attention to animal magnetism, observes, —
## 7: Denis (1838) 118 [2]

>" It is this somnambulism, an extreme result of animal magnetism, which allows of, and promises success, through its known efficacy in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It is by means of this incomprehensible, undefinable development of the general sensibility, that magnetic somnambules acquire, without the help of the senses, not only a knowledge of the surrounding objects on which their attention is directed, either spontaneously or by the will of another, but also the faculty of distinguishing objects removed at a distance, or placed, with regard to the somnambule, beyond opaque bodies ; and, by consequence, to know the economy and functions of their own system, or the systems of the individuals presented to them. The most positive, the most authentic, and incontrovertible facts, justify, establish, and guarantee all these phenomena of magnetic somnambulism, and prove that, under certain circumstances, the lucidity of somnambules may be of great succour to determine the seat and the nature of diseases, particularly those which come under the denomination of organic diseases." He then gives the nomenclature of those affections in which it has been applied with success.

>The most extraordinary phenomenon of magnetic, as well as of natural somnambulism, is clairvoyance, or vision without the use of the eyes ; yet no fact has ever been more clearly and indisputably established. It has been already seen, nay, it is a notorious fact, that natural somnambulists enjoy this faculty. It is inexplicable in them — it is equally so in the magnetic somnambulist; but, as I have before stated, we must abide by the evidence of the fact being conclusive, and not wander Out of the path of positive observation to pursue any ignis fatuus theory which imagination may suggest to explain the mystery. It may, indeed, appear tiresome, my adducing so many authorities, and citing so many facts of the same description ; but I have no alternative ; I am anxious to show clearly that the weight of evidence in proof of their existence is irresistible ; and when I reiterate that I am myself prepared to reproduce the same phenomena, the conditions of the operation being, ceteris paribus, similar, surely the most perverse of my antagonists will allow that no fairer appeal can be made to the common sense and judgment of mankind. The cases of vision during magnetic somnambulism without the instrumentality of the eyes are very numerous, and those which I shall here adduce are selected principally on account of their being attested by living authorities — men who hold a distinguished rank in the faculty of medicine, at Paris, and in other enlightened cities.

>It has been said, however, that this mode of perception cannot exactly be called seeing, inasmuch as when such somnambulists are closely examined how it is that they perceive the relations of external objects, they all agree in answering that it is by a kind of inward feeling which they are unable to explain. A somnambulist of Fischer assured him that he saw his internal organs, not as with the eyes, but he could not describe the manner in which he perceived them. A patient of Hufeland's said, " I see" when she was in the highest degree of lucidity only, at other times she generally used the expression " I feel," this or that part, or this or that change, &c. A patient of Gmelin's said she did not see, but feel, and with great delicacy, both internally and externally. In the magnetic sleep, Scherb's patient also declared that her sensations were rather those of feeling than of sight, and that this peculiar feeling during that state was much more acute and delicate than when awake. A cataleptic patient of Despine's said to those who were en rapport with her, " You think that I do not know what passes around me, but you are mistaken ; I see nothing, yet I feel something which makes an impression upon me, but which I cannot explain."* These are curious facts. How far the sense of feeling may, under a peculiar state of exaltation, take cognizance of the outward forms and conditions of material objects remains yet to be determined ; certain it is, that in well-authenticated cases, both of natural and magnetic somnambulism, individuals, through some other channel than the eye itself, perceive, discriminate, and perform a variety of actions which could not be accomplished without vision being in some way or other engaged. In the animal economy it is a physiological law that one organ shall assume a preternatural activity in order to supply the function of another whose structure may be deranged ; thus it is clearly proved that the liver acts vicariously with the lungs ; the skin with the kidneys. It is the office of the lungs to throw out of the system, during expiration, carbonaceous matter ; and when, therefore, this organ is diseased, the liver assumes, in a manner, its function, and throws off the surplus carbon with the biliary secretion. Hence the frequency of diseases of the liver in those persons who have resided in tropical countries, where, owing to the climate, the lungs may have become affected. In like manner the vessels of the skin, acting vicariously with those of the kidneys, throw off the watery parts of the blood when the secretion of this organ has, from any cause, been obstructed. Here there is an unquestionable transference of function between the grosser organs of organic life — and why should not the higher organs of sense, under certain abnormal conditions, act on a similar principle, vicariously with each other ? It is well known that persons who unhappily are blind and deaf acquire a preternaturally acute sense of touch, so that they are able to discriminate by feeling, properties of bodies which could not be so appreciated by other persons. This, however, is only a very subordinate physical manifestation of that law of derivation to which I here allude ; it may, nevertheless, be the initiatory condition of that transference of the senses which is in the magnetic state much more perfected.

>In the usual magnetic sleep, there sometimes occurs a peculiar state, seldom observed, and much dreaded by magnetisers, because very few among them possess the means of bringing it to a favourable issue. I will endeavour to describe it. A person plunged in the magnetic sleep (and it generally occurs in those individuals whose sleep is most profound) collapses into an extraordinary state, of which the following are the chief symptoms : — The somnambulist who heard his magnetiser perfectly, is suddenly seized with a fit of deafness ; he neither hears nor feels him any longer ; and the magnetiser discovers that he has entirely lost all control over him ; he no longer obeys his injunctions ; he is as dumb to him as to every body else ; his jaws are firmly fixed together, and it would be easier to break than sunder them ; he is motionless, yields to the laws of gravitation, and his body appears powerfully attracted to the ground. The pulse at the wrist diminishes its beats in number and intensity ; the temperature of the body perceptibly lowers, and inevitable death appears to be impending. If the magnetiser be familiar with this phenomenon, and do not abandon the patient, he will gradually recover from this state of concentration ; the pulse will resume its usual cadence, and, returning into the ordinary state of somnambulism, he will, on being questioned, state that he has had certain visions during his lethargic state ; but, by a strange anomaly, although still in the somnambulic state, he can hardly recal them, or even describe the sensations he experienced.

>How, excepting on magnetic principles, can we interpret the following anecdote of Alexander the Great ? It is related by Cicero that Ptolemy having been wounded by a poisoned arrow, was in great pain, and likely to die, when Alexander, sitting at the edge of the bed in a profound sleep, the dragon, nourished by his mother Olympia, appeared to him with a certain root in his mouth, and told him where it was to be found, which was not far from that place, and that it possessed such virtues that it would soon cure Ptolemy. On awakening, Alexander narrated his dream to his friend ; — they then sought the root, which was found, and not only was Ptolemy cured, but many other soldiers who had been wounded by the same arrows.* We have already seen that magnetic somnambulists prescribe, and that successfully, for the complaints of others, and here we have precisely the same fact. A cavern is also mentioned by Strabo, to which the sick resorted for the purpose of consulting sleeping priests. We learn, too, from Cicero, that when the Lacedemonian magistrates were embarrassed in their administration, they went to sleep in the temple of Pasiphae, so called from Past Phainein, te communicative to all." To the clairvoyance and lucidity which often occur during somnambulism may be referred many of the visions and predictions which are recorded in ancient history. The mystery of Oracles, the prophetic raving of the Sybils, the predictions of many of the ancient philosophers, are all explicable on the same principle. That the Sybils uttered their ratiocinations in a state of magnetic crisis or extase is clear, from the account given by St. Justin, who remarks that they did not themselves understand what they said, and that as soon as the instinct which animated them was extinguished, they lost all recollection of what they had predicted.* The Sybils and Bacchides, says Aristotle, who fall into a state of enthusiasm called sacred, do so, not from disease, but only from their natural temperament.-)- Avicenna also repudiates the idea of their being possessed, and, fantastically enough, ascribes their power of divination to the black bile4 Louis Buccaferrei, of Bologna, one of the commentators on Aristotle, insists that the gift of prophecy depends entirely on the temperament, and the melancholic is the one to which he assigns the development of this faculty .§ Gaspard Pencer wrote a treatise professedly on divination, in which he adopts partially the theory of Buccaferrei, but insists that in many cases it is a faculty peculiar to certain individuals.* The Jews, more than any other nation of antiquity, appear to have cultivated this somnambulic power : Josephus himself was constantly in what we now term a state of crisis, that is, in the highest degree of somnambulism, in which prevision is developed. On the authorities of Suetonius, Dio, and all Roman historians, he foretold the succession of Vespasian and Titus to the Roman empire, and this he did in the days of Nero, before Galba, Otho, or Vitellius, were thought of to succeed him. His faith in the lucidity of such visions was manifested on the occasion of his being in imminent danger after the fall of Jotapata. When the city had been taken, he sought refuge from the enemy in a deep pit, adjoining a large cavern, which could not be seen above ground. Here he met with forty persons of eminence, who had also, in a similar manner, concealed themselves; but on the third day he was betrayed by a woman, upon which Vespasian sent two tribunes to him, and ordered them to give Josephus their right hands as a security for his life, and to exhort him to come up. He was, however, afraid to comply with the request, lest he should be punished ; and Vespasian then sent Nicanor, a personal acquaintance of Josephus, to persuade him that no such perfidy would be committed. Thereupon the enraged soldiery threatened to set fire to the cavern, which the tribune would not permit, being desirous that Josephus should be taken alive. " And now," I quote the history itself, "as Nicanor lay hard at Josephus to comply, and he understood how the multitude of enemies threatened him, he called to mind the dreams which he had dreamed in the nighttime, whereby God had signified to him beforehand both the future calamities of the Jews, and the events which concerned the Roman emperors. Now Josephus was well able to give shrewd interpretations of such dreams as have been ambiguously delivered by God. Moreover he was not unacquainted with the prophecies contained in the sacred books, as being a priest himself and of the posterity of priests. And just then was he in an ecstacy ; and, setting before him the tremendous images of the dreams he had lately had, he put up a secret prayer to God, and said, * Since it pleaseth thee, who hast created the Jewish nation, to depress the same ; and since all their good fortune is gone over to the Romans ; and since thou hast made choice of this soul of mine to foretel what is to come to pass hereafter, I willingly give them my hands, and am content to live ; and I protest openly, that I do not go over to the Romans as a deserter from the Jews, but as a minister from thee.' When he had said this, he complied with Nicanor's invitation."* From what follows, it appears that Vespasian himself at last gave credit to his predictions. Nay, when Josephus was led by Nicanor before Vespasian, we almost recognise a direct magnetical action on those by whom he was immediately surrounded : they who were remote from him, cried out that he should be put to death ; but they who were near his person, relented, and were subdued.

>35. We are now come to our best and most powerful ecstatic ; the one whose light has opened our eyes ; the one who refuses no spiritual experiment. Theology, metaphysics, psychology, she answers all in a sense tinctured with neither pride nor error. Should the materialist not obtain from her the proofs he desires, he can not accuse her of entangling the question, or of bad faith. For several years past, in her magnetic sleep, she lives with the beings of the other world ; give her but the Christian and surname of the deceased persons, no matter at what period we desire her to perceive or consult, and she sees and converses with them at will. Hitherto, she has never failed in one experiment, and we shall be astonished at her clairvoyance, and the exact details she gives of persons who have departed this life.

>We generally believe that all created things existed from all eternity, and we ought not to confound, as I have said in the foregoing article, the enjoyment of the sight of the world of causes with the creation of the causes themselves. God can indeed, in a far superior manner to man, enjoy the harmony of his thoughts, which, with him, form but a perfect unity, and which with man form two, because man proceeds from the Divine thought, and is not God; he enjoys Hke God, when he is spiritualized, the view of the thoughts under their typical forms, but he does not create these thoughts; thus it remains proved to us, that the thoughts of the Eternal Being from all eternity, since they are of him, can not be annihilated without parcelling out the Divine Person ; man, who is one of these innumerable thoughts, exists like them from all eternity, he changes his condition like them all when they become materialized, and this gives rise to the belief in a spontaneous birth, because we take the effect for the cause, come to a stop at appearances, and not at the reality. Thus the soul having existed before dwelling in our body, has existed somewhere, in some form or other, and lived a life of activity, for there is no possible repose in nature ; all conduces to movement, without the latter it is nothingness, it is the parcelling out of the Great Being ; as I have said it is impossible. It must, therefore, be admitted that if the soul has existed from all time, it may have lived under the form of a germ ; and again, this form of a germ might be man himself, for every germ has its form within it and all its attributes, so then a form and all its attributes, without movement, without vibration, can not exist. Even though we should assimilate the germ man to the germ flower, it would not the less be proved that these two germs contain within them all that they must one day develop without them, are not the less as complicated as full of life, bound up in their envelope as in their bloom ; then we are constrained to admit a prior existence to the material one, and are equally constrained to place ourselves somewhere. This somewhere for us should be a place ; this place should be appropriated to our mode of being. Thus, we must have lived in this place, and in order to live it is necessary to act, we have acted ; in order to live it is necessary to feel, we have felt, but imperfectly, as has been just proved to us. We stood in need of a new position, in order to render an account to ourselves of the first one ; all beings are conscious of this pre-existence, and I can not do better than quote on this head what I am at this very moment reading (six months after the revelation was made to me), in a work of M. Loisson de Guinaumont, entitled *' Somnologie Magnetique,''^ P^ge '''4. Never was description more explicit and of better effect, especially from the affinity it has with this article.

>88. Emile Rey, ten years of age, of a waggish and very curious disposition, was a little neighbor of mine, and frequently came to spend an evening at my house, when I used to make him recite a few pieces in verse. When I had made the magic glass I have already spoken of, the composition of which was given me by M. Swedenborg, I had a mind to try the first experiment on Emile, though I did not think his turbulent nature well adapted to these kinds of visions, for which a little submission is required. He perceived nothing in it, but, as I have just said, he was very inattentive. One of his little comrades of a more quiet disposition, perceived in it different things which he desired to see, and this gave me the assurance that my mirror was a good one. I had a mind to try again on Emile, by the experiment of the water-bottle, which Cagliostro often employed to convince his auditors of his magic power : he beheld very distinctly divers remote places ; perceiving, from this, that he had propensities for the magnetic sleep, I magnetized him, and in a few minutes he slept; his curious disposition led him to travelling ; he acquired, in a very short time, this speciality, and left me no doubt as to the worth of his clairvoyance. It was this child of whom I spoke farther back, whose sleep was called in question by M. Demarest, because, in a distant view at that gentleman's house, he took a surtout for a paletot, and, in a closed box, a small twosous piece for a liard. I tried to put this child in communication with spirits disengaged from matter ; I told him to ask to see his an^el. " Here he is." — " How is he dressed ?" " He is quite naked." — I repeated a prayer for the dismissal of this spirit if he were not sent by God ; Emile said, " I no longer see anything, he is gone." I summon the good one. " Here he is ; 'tis no longer the same." — "Why so?" '* This one is dressed ; he has a blue robe, a pink girdle, beautiful white wings, fine flaxen hair ; he is much handsomer than the other!" I desire the latter to be gone, as the former ; he remains, and tells Emile that he is sent by God. " By what sign may you be recognised, in case the evil one should think proper to take your place V He points out to Emile a small white spot on his forehead. "Have you lived on earth 1" "Yes." — "When did you die?" "I don't knovi^." — "What do you do in heaven V " I play there ; we have plenty of amusement." — "With whom do you play f "With children of my own age ; I ride on horseback." — I ask Emile how old this angel appears to be. He replies : " About my age." — " Are you fond, too, of riding V " Very ; my angel is on a fine dapple-gray horse." — "What! at this moment?" "Yes." — " What is there in heaven V* " A fine garden, fine fruits, fine flowers." — " Can we eat these fruits and pluck these flowers?" — " No, God forbiJs it." " Does your angel see the earth ?" " No, he can see only heaven." — " Does he see the men of the earth 1" " No, he can see but me." — " Can he see me also 1" " He could do so, since you are en rapport with me." — "Would your angel be so good as to show himself to you when you have been waked up?" "Yes." — I terminate this sitting. Emile, on awaking, perceives his angel when I lay my hand on his heart, as he had recommended me to do ; he gives me the same details as to his dress as when sleeping.

>To initiate your clairvoyante in this kind of apparition, first look out for a subject as independent as possible of your will ; make no physical experiment wherein the communication of thoughts is often necessary. Seek for a natural, voluntary clairvoyante, and not a sickly one, if possible. Conduct his speciality toward these communications, without ever demanding of him any but those appertaining to maladies. Begin by interesting him in an apparition, asking him if he would not be glad to see some departed friend who had been dear to him ; he will be curious, his desire will be strong, and the person mentally demanded by you and by him will shortly present himself. Continue this kind of experiment, changing the personage as often as you can. As soon as you perceive that the view of a deceased being greatly affects your clairvoyante, that he appears delighted at seeing him again, tell him to ask this spirit to have the goodness to conduct him into the places he inhabits ; he will readily do so, on one condition, which is that the clairvoyante shall descend again to earth, after a short interval of time, not exceeding ten minutes, according to the susceptible nature of the subject. To aid him in his departure, place him under the care of God and his guide ; place your hand at some distance from the crown of his head, your fingers downward and brought together to a point, desire them to attract and open the fictitious space necessary to the passage of the soul. When you see him leaning back, his arms languidly dropping down, his face flushed and assuming an expression of beatitude, leave him for the time agreed upon in this ecstatic contemplation. For prudence sake, ever keep your eyes fixed on the plexus, principally the solar or pit of the stomach, retaining by your will sufficient life in the body to prevent all risk. If your clairvoyant should not return at the appointed time, and you perceive that his countenance is getting discolored, assuming a dark sallow hue, proceed no further, death is at hand. Close the door upon him, making with a determined force of will, a few transversal passes over his head and before his face ; if it be long before he answers you, do n't be disturbed, do as if you were pulling him from on high with a cord, blow warmly on his heart, and you will see him pass again into the ordinary state of magnetic sleep. Ask him what he has seen, do not laugh, or you will learn nothinor. Be of sfood faith, see in his revelations an act of madness or truth without telling him of it, and think what you please. All the counsels I have just given are dictated only by a wise prudence ; there are many ecstatics of different shades, with whom we have no need of this prudence ; but there are some with whom we can not be too circumspect, as I well know by experience. We ought to consider ourselves as warned on this head ; death or insanity might be the consequence of such attempts. The ecstasy by which we communicate with spirits on earth presents no danger ; it is one of the tasks which somnambulists perform with the greatest facility. I also recommend that if the clairvoyante, in speaking with spirits, should solicit from you certain marks of respect or assent to certain gestures, still preserving your dignity as a man, who ought to bend the knee to his Creator only, refuse not doing what could not in the least affect you. Be covfiding, reserved, voluntary , reasonable, devoid of passion, and you will be indemnified for your pains, rendering yourself more happy than you ever were before ; you will be less inclined to curse the earth and its sorrows, inasmuch as you will perceive that those sorrows are beneficial ; you will no longer, in your sufferings, accuse God, because you will know that he is infinitely good ; you will no longer be puffed up with your knowledge, because the further you go, the more you will perceive that you know nothing ; you will patient admire this terrestrial mechanism, so beautiful, so grand, in one point of view, so insignificant in another ; you will be in haste to again inhabit your former dwelling and be less attached to your material baubles. You will no longer tremble before your coffin, which is the gate to the temple of happiness wherein you are to live for ever ! !

>On earth is there aught that we can hide from the perception of a clairvoyante ? It is not, therefore, ridiculous to admit that in the world of spirits none is any longer able to conceal aught ; it is the book of life which will be open to all. The masks of calm concealing rage, smiles concealing bitterness, virtue concealing vice, will be left on earth. We can not deny these truths after having studied magnetic somnambulism. Need we invite our readers to a perusal of the works of the learned Swede 1 No, these few passages, we are certain of it, will be a better invitation than any we could give. We abstain, therefore, from all insinuation in this respect.

>In this state there is a strong sympathy existing between the operator and his subject. The chain of sympathy which connects the mind of the operator with that of his subject, is animal electricity, — the same fluid which is the agent of all muscular motion. It is through the agency of this fluid that magnetic sleep is induced. The operator sits down with the determination to put his subject to sleep: all the powers of his mind are concentrated on this object. His will being exercised to this point, the electric fluid passes from his own brain and nerves, to the brain and system of his patient, and forms between the two, a chain of sympathy. The one, then, is completely subject to the control of the other; and in this manner you may easily account for all the phenomena witnessed in the sympathetic somnambulist.

>In Prussia, Austria, Bavaria, Russia, laws were passed by the respective governments, prohibiting its practice by all persons, excepting by physicians regularly educated. In France, the discovery by the Marquis de Puysegur of magnetic somnambulism had already thrown an additional charm over its study, and enriched physiology and psychology with a newly-developed class of facts in the highest degree curious and interesting. Next to Puysegur appeared the Abbe Faria, who opened in Paris an institution for magnetism which attracted the attention of many scientific men. He was himself endued with the magnetic power to a degree which would have appeared incredible, were it not a notorious fact that its intensity augments with exercise. The daily increasing converts to magnetism attached themselves to this man of wonders ; they listened with interest to his lectures, and learned by his instructions how themselves to conduct the operation. It is impossible to conceive a more direct and conclusive experimentum cruris than this. The magnetiser assumed not to himself any exclusive privilege, nor did he pretend to be initiated in any mysterious or incommunicable cabalistic art ; on the contrary, he assured his auditors that they had only to investigate the phenomena to be convinced of their reality, and invited them in their turn to try the operation themselves, assuring them that they would be as successful as himself, if they only complied with the elementary principles of the science, which are in themselves simple and explicit, and equally intelligible to all. The instructions of the Abbe Faria were by many followed, — his predictions verified : and who that has thus practically studied animal magnetism has ever turned away sceptical from it ?

>It has been already stated that the magnetic operation induces sleep ; it is a state of sleep, however, very different from natural sleep ; its phenomena were first described by the Marquis de Puyscgur, but, in conformity with the plan already laid down, I shall detail its physical conditions before proceeding to those phenomena, which are of a purely psychical nature, and in the highest degree interesting, inasmuch as they reveal to us the manifestations of a spiritual existence, independent of the ordinary instruments of corporeal organisation. In contradistinction to the natural, this has been termed the magnetic sleep, or somnambulism, which may be more or less complete, — that is to say, its phenomema may be more or less perfectly developed. In this peculiar state of sleep, the surface of the body is sometimes acutely sensible, — but more frequently the sense of feeling is absolutely annihilated. The jaws are firmly locked, and resist every effort to wrench them open ; the joints are often rigid, and the limbs inflexible ; and not only is the sense of feeling, but the senses of smell, hearing, and sight, also, are so deadened to all external impressions, that no pungent odour, loud report, or glare of light, can excite them in the slightest degree. The body may be pricked, pinched, lacerated, or burnt; fumes of concentrated liquid ammonia may be passed up the nostrils ; the loudest reports suddenly made close upon the ear ; dazzling and intense light may be thrown upon the pupil of the eye ; yet so profound is the physical state of lethargy, that the sleeper will remain undisturbed, and insensible to tortures, which, in the waking state, would be intolerable. These may appear startling assertions, and it should be conceded, that in proportion as any alleged facts may appear extraordinary, do they demand additional weight of evidence to establish them. This state of insensibility, now described, therefore requires to be proved by the most direct positive evidence; it must be evidence, at once clear, unequivocal, and above all suspicion ; it must be evidence, too, that is tangible to those who will entertain the investigation, and this I am prepared to adduce. Can more in reason be desired ? I cite authorities, I refer to scenes which occurred in public hospitals, in the presence of living witnesses, conscientious and competent observers, only because I cannot bring the experiments under the eye of the reader while perusing this page ; but if he choose to visit any of my public seances, he may convince himself, by personal observation, of the truth of the facts which are here stated ; and I make this appeal, fully sensible how difficult it is to disturb that apathy which scepticism usually engenders, or to excite even the desire of inquiry in minds which have already come prematurely to a conclusion.
## 20: Denis (1838) 48 [1]

>To this testimony of M. Bouillet, may be added that of M. Husson, President of the Academy of Medicine, who, in his address to that learned Society, observes, — " The operator has succeeded, during this singular state (somnambulism), in producing paralysis, or so entirely closing the senses against all external impressions, that a bottle containing several ounces of concentrated ammonia was held immediately under the nostrils, for five, ten, fifteen minutes, or more, without producing the slightest effect; without impeding respiration, or provoking sternutation. The skin was perfectly insensible, even when pinched so as to leave black marks ; nay, it was absolutely insensible to the burning of moxa, and to the acute irritation of hot water strongly impregnated with mustard, although when the skin recovered its normal state, the pain thereby caused was intensely felt." The authority of Dr. Bertrand may be cited to the same effect. " I saw," he observes, " insensibility so decidedly manifested in certain magnetic somnambules, that it could be proved by the most conclusive tests. I saw a magnetiser who used to put his somnambules to sleep before a numerous assembly, and entreat every person present to provide himself with a pin, and thrust them all unexpectedly, at the same moment, into different parts of the body. Accordingly, while the somnambulist was on one occasion singing, forty or fifty pins were thus thrust simultaneously into his flesh without causing the least appreciable alteration in his voice."
## 21: Denis (1838) 52 [1]

>It is impossible to conceive any fact more clearly established by human evidence than this perfect insensibility during the magnetic sleep ; but it remains for me to add that painful surgical operations have been performed on patients in this state, who during the whole time never manifestid the slightest sign of consciousness.

>" On the day appointed for the operation, M. Cloquet, on his arrival at half-past ten in the morning, found the patient dressed, and seated in an arm-chair, in the attitude of a person in a tranquil natural sleep. She had returned, nearly an hour previously, from mass, which she was accustomed to attend at that time. M. Chapelain had thrown her into the magnetic sleep after her return and she then spoke with much composure of the operation she was about to undergo. All the arrangements being made, she undressed herself, and seated herself in a chair. M. Chapelain supported the right arm : the left was allowed to hang down.
## 23: Denis (1838) 57 [1]

>In this case it may be observed that the somnambulic state was maintained for an extraordinary length of time ; and then when the patient was awakened, she was again thrown into a similar state. How long this second sleep lasted we are not informed ; but this practice I do not hesitate to deprecate. The magnetic sleep, accompanied by insensibility, is restorative to the system, if continued for about two hours ; but when it lasts longer, it becomes the source of great excitement, and destroys, rather than restores, nervous energy. From the facts above detailed, it is evident that surgical science should avail itself of this peculiar state to mitigate, or rather supersede, the necessity of inflicting pain during operations ; and thus practically applied, magnetism would be of the most essential utility. What is to be the use of this new science? — what good is it to effect ? are questions daily asked ; but we may rest assured, that however ignorant we may be, at the moment of a discovery, of its ultimate utility, yet every new truth will not fail eventually to admit of some practical application, which will contribute to the benefit, and the happiness, of mankind. It may have been exclaimed against Franklin — What good purpose can be achieved by drawing down the lightning from Heaven by a paper kite ? Has not one philosopher been already killed by his presumptuous folly ? What advantage can possibly be derived from these Promethean exploits ? Yet did this discovery of the electric fluid not only enlarge our views of the constitution of the physical universe, but led to the construction of instruments whereby it admitted of a direct practical application in the treatment of disease which all medical men now appreciate. It is the same with animal magnetism ; its direct utility in causing— what might indeed be esteemed a blessing, — an absolute suspension of physical suffering, during otherwise painful surgical operations is, by the preceding cases, distinctly manifest ; its curative power in alleviating and removing distressing chronic affections which had resisted every other mode of treatment, has been also clearly established ; but it is not possible for us, at present, to raise the veil of futurity, and trace out all the advantages which may hereafter be derived from it.

>* A medical gentleman, who takes considerable interest in animal magnetism, knowing that Mr. Wright, the patient referred to, was an highly -educated and intelligent gentleman, submitted to him a number of questions, which he succinctly answered, concerning the effects produced, the sensations he experienced, &c. With a copy of these he has favoured me, and I here subjoin them, premising only that I was not at the time acquainted with the parties, and that none of the questions or answers in any same magnetic effect was produced by me in the presence of the French commissioners, who attested it in their report in the following terms : — " It is chiefly on M. Petit, thirty-two years of age, school-master at Athis, that the convulsive movements have been exhibited with the most precision by the approach of the magnetiser's fingers. M. Dupotet, in introducing him to the commissioners on the 18th August, 1836, announced that he was easily thrown into magnetic sleep, during which state M. Dupotet could at will, without expressing his intention, by the mere approximation of his fingers towards those parts which the commissioners would be pleased to name in writing, bring on way emanated from me. They were, in fact, only communicated to me while the present sheet was passing through the press.

>* The unclouding of the mind previous to death, or the prevision of the dying, is a phenomenon manifestly identical with the clairvoyance, or lucidity, of the magnetic somnambulist. Thus does the study of animal magnetism, as we go deeper and deeper into its apparent mysteries, assume a peculiarly sacred interest ; it is the unveiling to us of our spiritual nature, and leads us onward even to the verge of that future state of existence, which all men, as they approach, even the most shallow Pyrrhonists, contemplate with a feeling of awe, not unmingled with apprehension.

>But to return. It was the Marquis de Puysegur, who first induced, or rather, observed particularly, that peculiar state of being which, in contradistinction to natural, is termed magnetic somnambulism. He had been a pupil of Mesmer, and having retired to his estate at Busancy, near Soissons, practically adopted the instructions of his preceptor, and treated magnetically the sick persons who applied to him. He was a man universally esteemed for his integrity and philanthropy ; he was also a powerful and efficient magnetiser, and the cures which he wrought were so marked, and so numerous, that the peasantry thronged from all parts of the neighbouring country to consult him. On one of these occasions, he discovered the psychical phenomena referred to ; and so marvellous did they appear, even to him, that in transmitting his memoir to the secretary of the Harmonic Society, at Strasburg, he could not refrain from observing, " The time is not yet ripe for the publication of the facts I have witnessed ; they are difficult to believe, notwithstanding the mass of evidence which attests them ; I therefore beg you will not lend this memoir to any one, for I confide my account of these cases to you only, in order that they may assist you in your reflections, and facilitate you in the means of curing, even more successfully than I have done, during your magnetic trials." It appears, that while magnetising his gardener, he observed him fall into a deep and tranquil sleep ; and it then occurred to him, that he would address some questions to him, as he might have done to a natural somnambulist. He did so ; and the man immediately answered him with much intelligence and clearness, upon which he persevered in the magnetic operation, and soon found that he possessed an extraordinary psychical influence over him ; that all further manual movements were unnecessary ; and that without speaking he could mentally communicate with, and control, his ideas. " It is from this simple man," says he, " this tall and stout rustic, twenty-three years of age, enfeebled by disease, or rather, by sorrow, and, therefore, the more pre-disposed to be affected by any great natural agent, — it is from this man, I repeat, that I derive instruction and knowledge. He is no longer, when in the magnetic state, a peasant, who can hardly utter a single sentence, — he is a being, to describe whom I cannot find a name. I need not speak, I have only to think before him, when he instantly hears, and answers me. Should anybody come into the room, he sees him, if I desire it, and addresses him, and says what I wish him to say ; not, indeed, exactly as I dictate to him, but as truth requires. When he wants to add more than I deem it prudent strangers should hear, I stop the flow of his ideas, and of his conversation, in the middle of a word, and give his thoughts quite a different turn." He then adds : " I know of no subject more profound, more lucid, than this peasant in his crisis. I have several patients approaching his state of lucidity, but none equal him."
## 27: Denis (1838) 110 [1]

>" Generally speaking," adds M. Deleuze, " the magnetic somnambule perceives innumerable relations in all objects ; he perceives them with an extreme rapidity, and in one minute runs through a train of ideas which to us would require many hours. Time seems to vanish before him ; he himself wonders at the variety and rapidity of his perceptions ; he is inclined to ascribe them to the inspiration of another intelligence. He now sees this new being within himself ; he considers himself, while in somnambulism, as a different being from himself when awake ; he speaks of himself in the third person, as of somebody whom he knows, submits to his remarks, — to whom he gives advice, and for whom he feels more or less sympathy. He now hears an intelligence, a soul speaking to him, and revealing what he wishes to know."*

>The clairvoyance of magnetic somnambulists was also unequivocally attested by the conjoint evidence of the commissioners of the French Academy. They carefully examined the fact, and in their report give the following details. I was, it will be observed, in the first case, myself the operator. On the 18th of March, 1826, at half -past eight in the evening, M. Petit was set asleep in one minute.

>The phenomena of magnetic somnambulism, it will be observed, are thus very similar to those which occur during natural somnambulism. Both states of being arc equally mysterious and perplexing. — The Baron Massias draws between them the following diagnosis : —

>" Artificial or magnetic somnambulism," says he, " is the result of certain processes, consisting in gestures, manipulations, and acts of volition, operating on persons susceptible of exhibiting its phenomena ; it is, as it were, inoculated by the magnetiser. The natural state of the patient submitted to his action when susceptible of receiving it, is generally separated from the subsequent magnetic state by a somnolence of a few minutes. In the crisis a great number of faculties lie dormant, which has caused animal magnetism to retain the name of somnambulism, although magnetism may sometimes be induced without sleep.
## 31: Denis (1838) 184 [1]

>Hence from the facts above adduced, which I hold to be incontrovertibly established, it will appear that the following are some of the more ostensible psychical phenomena which magnetic somnambulists exhibit.
## 32: Denis (1838) 197 [1]

>III. Transference of the senses. — The clairvoyant faculty sometimes develops itself locally, requiring that the object to be perceived shall be placed in juxtaposition with certain parts of the body, as with the epigastrium, the tips of the fingers, the forehead, or even back part of the head. It is not during the magnetic somnambulism only that this extraordinary mode of perception develops itself ; it occurs often in catalepsy and hysterical affections. A cataleptic patient of Petetin distinguished in succession several cards which had been slipped under the bed-clothes, and laid upon her stomach ; she told the hour of a watch held in the closed hand of an inquirer ; and recognised, in like manner, an ancient medal grasped in the hand of one of the spectators. Another day the same patient recognised a letter placed under the waistcoat of M. Petetin, then a purse which had been slipped there by a sceptic ; she also indicated the number of gold and silver coins contained in each end of the purse. After this experiment, she announced that she was about to tell successively what each person present possessed about him most remarkable, which she actually did. She also perceived, through a screen, that Madame Petetin on going out took her husband's cloak, and made him discover the mistake.
## 33: Denis (1838) 200 [1]

>IV. Exaltation of knowledge. — That persons during magnetic somnambulism possess a knowledge beyond that which they possess in their waking state, is also certain. It is a repetition of the same phenomenon which occurs in natural somnambulism ; furthermore, it has been observed that on the accession of certain diseases, especially fever attended with head symptoms, the intellectual faculties are preternaturally acute. This is an old observation of physicians. It is stated by Levinus Lemnius, (lib. 2, cap. 2, Collect, de Occult Nat. Miraculis), that he himself healed some sick persons who in their fits of fever pronounced an oration as if it were deeply studied, and were in all respects most accomplished, yet who in health were little better than idiots. Cardan (De Rerum Variet., lib. 8, cap. 43), relates that Phliarius Poletanus, an Italian, distempered in body, spoke the Dutch tongue, which he had never learned ; and that after passing several worms, and recovering, he lost that ability, and could then only speak his own language. Petrus Apponensis (Comment, at Problem 1, sect. 3, de Aristot.), mentions a woman who in a melancholy sickness spoke Latin ; yet on recovering could not speak a word of it. Sigebertus Continuator says, that Norbert of Nigella, when grievously sick, did, from the devil, repeat the Canticles from one end to the other. A host of authorities might be cited to the same effect.
## 34: Denis (1838) 218 [1]

>From the facts which I have now adduced, it is evident that, however extraordinary they may appear, phenomena are developed in certain abnormal conditions of the body which are similar to those that occur during magnetic somnambulism, and this circumstance alone should suspend the summary judgment of those who are inclined to disbelieve in the possibility of such facts ever occurring ; for it is not more marvellous that an utter extinction of physical sensibility, somniloquism, clairvoyance, prevision, &c. should appear during magnetic than during natural somnambulism. Both states are extraordinary, but neither incredible ; and after all, it should be remembered that life, mind, the soul, our existence in all its relations, is a mystery, in the very shadow and perplexity of which it is our duty to watch with attention and diligence every fact which, when well attested, forms a part of that induction which may eventually relieve us from the embarrassment of our ignorance. The principle upon which we estimate that which is possible or impossible is erroneous ; the experience of the past ought not to impose boundaries on the experience of the future. Our eyes are daily closed to an infinite number of sublime truths, which revolve around us in the simplest occurrences of nature ; and he who would unseal them ought not to be repudiated as a visionary or impostor. We forget that every grain of sand on the sea shore has its position determined by laws as immutable as those which maintain the heavenly bodies in their orbits ; the one may appear an insignificant, the other a sublime object of contemplation ; but the wonder and mystery of the one is not greater than the wonder and mystery of the other. Our philosophers restrict their attention too much to the material, to the total neglect of the immaterial, portion of their being ; they forget that mind must be governed by laws as fixed and constant as those which govern the physical universe. " All the organs of sense," says Coleridge, " are framed for a corresponding world of sense, and we have it. All the organs of spirit are framed for a corresponding world of spirit, though the latter organs are not developed in all alike."* This is perfectly true, and I am persuaded that the study of animal magnetism is alone the path which will lead us to any just conception of the laws of our spiritual existence. Let the facts of animal magnetism be sifted and weighed with as much suspicion and care as any other evidence which might be brought into a court of justice ; they will, I am satisfied, be thoroughly substantiated, and it will then be found that the consequences to which they lead are of the highest and most sacred importance to the moral government and happiness of mankind.

>The effects produced by such processes were not less strange than the processes themselves. 1 have already described certain extraordinary phenomena arising from this action, and shall here subjoin a few more equally curious. The patients submitted to this kind of magnetisation experienced various unusual sensations, such as undefinable pains in the body, particularly in the head and stomach ; an increase or suppression of cutaneous perspiration ; palpitation of the heart, and a momentary obstruction of breathing. Sometimes a certain exaltation of the mind, and a lively sense of comfort was experienced ; the nervous system in particular was often powerfully affected. The organs of the senses also underwent unusual modifications ; ringing in the ears, vertigo, and sometimes somnolency of a peculiar character, supervened. These effects, which were diversified according to the nature of the diseases and idiosyncracies of the patients, became more and more developed as the operation proceeded ; and this series of phenomena terminated by convulsions. This convulsive state being established in one patient, soon manifested itself in all the rest. It was designated, as I have already explained, by the name of the magnetic crisis ; and as this usually was the ultimatum of the results produced, it was looked upon as the chief object of the magnetic influence, and as the means emown words, from the instructions, which he gave in confidence to his pupils. They are arranged in the form of a catechism :

>The effects produced by such processes were not less strange than the processes themselves. 1 have already described certain extraordinary phenomena arising from this action, and shall here subjoin a few more equally curious.

It was designated, as I have already explained, by the name of the magnetic crisis ; and as this usually was the ultimatum of the results produced, it was looked upon as the chief object of the magnetic influence, and as the means employed by nature to effect a cure. Sometimes these convulsions were of remarkable violence and duration, and on this account patients seized by them were carried into an adjoining room, called salle des crises, where they gradually recovered their senses; and then, which is a remarkable circumstance, they experienced no inconvenience, excepting a slight sensation of fatigue; many even stated that they felt decidedly relieved. To these physiological, were often added very extraordinary moral, phenomena ; some of the patients burst into immoderate fits of laughter, others melted into tears ; they often appeared mutually attracted by irresistible impulses of sympathy, and seemed to entertain the most lively affection for each other. But the most surprising circumstance was the prodigious influence which the magnetiser exercised over his patients. The least sign of his will excited or calmed the convulsions, commanded love or hatred. He thus stood before them like a magician with his wand, under the waving of which their souls and bodies were kept in submissive obedience. Such were the results of the magnetic operations as conducted by Mesmer, which the ancient commissioners verified, and minutely described in their reports.
## 37: Denis (1838) 233 [1]

>M. de Puysegur further adds, " If, when magnetising a patient, you perceive that he experiences a certain numbness, or slight spasm, attended with nervous shocks ; and should you then observe that he closes his eyes, you must rub them lightly with your thumbs to prevent the convulsive winking of the eyelids. You will know that your patient is in the magnetic sleep when you see him sensible to your action when you hold your thumb opposite to the plexus. A patient, in his crisis, should answer no one but his magnetiser, and allow nobody else to touch him."
## 38: Denis (1838) 241 [1]

>The same thing happens with a certain secretion, which is supposed to be facilitated or retarded by certain processes, whereas the result often proves the reverse of what was intended. So, also, in endeavouring to awake a somnambule, I remember often having been much perplexed ; for it is an established rule among magnetisers, that a somnambulist be awakened by transverse manipulations over his eyes and face. But it has often occurred to me that I have been unable to awaken, and obliged to leave the somnambulist in his sleep, notwithstanding I had employed all the means prescribed in similar cases. In vain have I rubbed the eyelids, even so much as to produce ecchymosis on this very sensible part ; still sleep continued much beyond the period I had assigned ; and what is still more remarkable, its intensity was greater than when the regular magnetic sleep had not been disturbed.
## 39: Denis (1838) 254 [1]

>Another case of this kind was transmitted to M. de Puysegur by M. Segrettier, landowner at Nantes. The following are the particulars: — " A young lady of distinguished birth, who seemed to enjoy most excellent health, happening to be on a visit at the chateau of her relative, the Marquis de B., was indulging with the rest of the company in passing sundry jokes upon magnetism. Her uncle, M. de B., who outstepped by his sarcastic remarks everybody present, and was gesticulating with great freedom, began to direct his pretended influence upon his niece, when they both set about magnetising each other as fast as they could. At first the young lady laughed very heartily, but it was soon discovered that this laughter was anything but natural ; and the first surprise excited by this phenomenon soon gave way to unspeakable terror, when it was manifest that she was gradually losing her reason and the use of her senses. Indeed, she could no longer see, nor hear, nor speak ; her eyes were immoveably fixed ; her neck, outstretched, resembled a weaker magnet violently attracted by a stronger one ; she followed her magnetiser everywhere, and yielded to his sole influence. The spectators attempted to separate them, but this only provoked dreadful convulsions. Her magnetiser, on his part, felt extraordinary sensations, which, in addition to the shock he had experienced by the alarming state of his niece, had entirely altered his features, which became extremely pale and dejected. In the course of a few hours, the crisis of the magnetised young lady gradually ceased, and she complained of acute pains in her stomach. The remainder of the day, and the following night, were passed alternately in convulsions and magnetic sleep ; and this state lasted several days."
## 40: Denis (1838) 257 [1]

>No symptom can indicate the moment when this crisis supervenes ; I have observed it a great many times. It has often occurred when I intended to bring on a cessation of the usual magnetic sleep, that the somnambulist suddenly, and against my will, collapsed into this singular condition, in which he remained for several hours together. It is the most extraordinary state known in animal magnetism ; it is, perhaps, the most dangerous, and also the best calculated to afford instruction, when we know how to question, in proper time, these extatic somnambules. If we could hit upon the ideas which are uppermost in their minds, it is probable that we might obtain the most useful revelations ; there is but one moment for this ; we must seize the instant of transition from the ecstatic to the usual somnambulic state, for they soon lose all recollection of the sensations they experienced. This state seems to be the limit of an entirely new order of being ; " it is an unfathomable mystery, in which the mind is wholly lost ;" and I consider it the most dangerous crisis that can occur, and the most likely to be attended by fatal consequences, should the magnetiser leave the patient to himself, after having plunged him into an ecstatic sleep.
## 41: Denis (1838) 262 [1]

>As I have already observed, it is sometimes very difficult to awaken or bring patients out of the magnetic sleep ; speaking generally, it is more difficult to conduct the operation after sleep is induced than it is to produce sleep itself. In most treatises on animal magnetism, it is stated that magnetisers can at pleasure restore their patients to the ordinary, or waking state. This is an error. I have often, in a few minutes, brought on sleep, and could not for hours afterwards awaken the patient, notwithstanding that 1 have energetically applied all the processes usually prescribed in such cases. In vain have I exerted my abilities to the utmost ; the more I have wished and willed to induce the waking state, the more has the intensity of the sleep increased. I have passed my fingers over the eyelids until I have produced ecchymosis, yet all my efforts have proved unavailing ; and it is a curious fact, which deserves attention, that when such persons awake from this indomitable sleep they fall again into somnambulism, and then the slightest noise will awaken them. A case of this description was lately communicated to the Lancet by Dr. Sigmond, the Lecturer on Materia Medica and Therapeutics at the Windmill .street School of Medicine in this city. Unlike many of his professional brethren, this gentleman has not disdained to make animal magnetism the subject of conscientious investigation, and has performed himself, to confirm his conviction, several experiments.
## 42: Denis (1838) 272 [1]

>There are many persons naturally very susceptible of the magnetic influence. They cannot endure the operation when steadily and vigorously conducted ; the accumulation of the magnetic fluid in their system produces an alarming disturbance of all the organic functions ; the action of the heart becomes increased, the breathing hurried, violent convulsive fits supervene ; and should such persons be labouring under any aneurismal affection, disposition to apoplexy, or far advanced phthisical diseases, the consequences may be fatal. As a general rule, the susceptibility of the patient increases with every successive sitting. He who at first resisted the operation for a considerable time, at length speedily, even in a few seconds, falls into somnambulism ; and when the magnetiser has invested him with an extreme aptitude to pass from one state to another, the least gesture from him — a look indicative of his intention — his will expressed with energy, is sufficient. It should also be observed, that during natural sleep persons are magnetised with as much, or perhaps more, facility than when awake. Under the magnetic influence they soon become restless and agitated, and the natural passes into the magnetic sleep, characterised by all the phenomena which are so peculiar to this state of being.
## 43: Denis (1838) 312 [1]

>Jamblichus so distinctly describes the state of magnetic somnambulism induced by the mystic ceremonies in these temples, that the passage might be appropriately transferred into any modern treatise on animal magnetism. " This state," says he, " commences by a certain heaviness or inclination of the head forwards, the eyes close involuntarily, and we find ourselves in a state between sleeping and waking. In ordinary sleep we do not distinctly and fully remark either what occurs or where we are; but when sleep comes from divinity, we in reality sleep not. We perceive perfectly objects, . and distinguish them more clearly than in our accustomed waking state ; so that it is in this kind of sleep that vaticination principally takes place."* " They who are thus inspired," he continues, " do not live as other men, even in their corporeal state, because many of them do not burn when fire is applied to their bodies ; the divinity that inspires them from within repels it, so that even if they are burned they are not sensible of it any more than of the punctures of iron pins, or other torments. You will see them walk in places which would be otherwise impracticable." He then proceeds to describe the different effects produced according to the different modes of inspiration. " Some of the inspired," he observes, " are tranquil, others are agitated and move the whole of the body, or only certain limbs ; some dance or sing, or do quite the contrary ; others again extend the body and rise themselves in the air ; the sound of their voices is sometimes equal and prolonged ; sometimes unequal and interrupted ; sometimes strong and sometimes weak."f These effects, arising from what in that age was presumed to be the inspiration of the gods, manifestly correspond with the effects produced byanimal magnetism as attested by the French commissioners in 1784.

>" It is well known," says the Professor, " that somnambulists, when they awake out of the magnetic sleep, have not the slightest recollection of what may have taken place in it. When she awoke out of her sleep, Miss M. was as cheerful as ever, and had not the most distant idea of her vision. The expression of pain she exhibited during the crisis, which seemed to proceed so entirely from an internal conviction of the reality of the fact, and the obstinacy with which she adhered to her assertion of its truth, induced me to give her credit. I mentioned the case to Professor Schmidt, in order that he might be a witness to the fact. I awaited with great anxiety the hour when I could again set my somnambulist asleep, in order to ascertain whether she would again have the same vision. For a considerable period during the crisis, nothing of the kind appeared. She was, as usual, quite cheerful, and spoke a great deal, until, all at once, marks of sorrow were exhibited in her countenance. She turned away her face, and hid it on her arm, which she had placed on the arm of her chair, and wept in silence. At length, I asked her what ailed her. * The same as yesterday,' she answered ; i a death has taken place in our family — I know it for certain.' She thought it fortunate for her that she knew nothing of this when awake, because it would occasion her so much grief. I again asked her whether she did not also know the individual who was dead ; and she repeated that she would be able to tell me in a future crisis, provided I put the question to her. In the following crisis, as soon as she was set asleep, she again began to weep. She requested me to use every means of diverting her attention from this circumstance during her sleep, and I endeavoured to do so by introducing other subjects of conversation ; yet she frequently reverted to it. Had I foreseen the circumstances which subsequently made it impossible for me to place her more frequently in a state of crisis, I should, upon the last occasion, instead of diverting her thoughts from the subject in question, rather have endeavoured to ascertain whether she could give any further particulars of the event. But I neglected the opportunity, and reserved my questions for future crises, which could no longer take place. Four or five days after the last sitting, upon entering her apartment, I found Miss M. much downcast, with appearances on her countenance indicating that she had been weeping. On inquiring into the reason of this, she pointed to a letter which lay upon the table, and said it contained intelligence of the death of a near relative and particular friend. T asked her w r hether she had received any previous accounts of the indisposition of this individual. She answered, ' No — none at all ; the intelligence came upon me quite unexpectedly.' Nor was she at all aware of anv presentiment she had of the event."

>Dr. Arndt, the eminent German physician, relates, that being one day seated near the bed of one of his somnambulists, on a sudden she became agitated, uttered sighs, and, as if tormented by some vision, exclaimed, " O heavens ! my father ! he is dying !" A few moments afterwards, she awoke, seemed quite cheerful, and recollected nothing of the anxiety she had so recently manifested. She again relapsed twice into the same state of magnetic sleep, and each time she was tormented by the same vision. Being asked what had happened to her father, she answered, " He is bathed in blood — he is dying." Soon afterwards she awoke, became composed, and the scene finished. Some weeks afterwards, Dr. Arndt found this lady pensive and sorrowful. She had just received from her father, who was at a distance of some hundred miles — an account of a serious accident which had befallen him. In ascending the stair of his cellar, the door had fallen upon his breast — a considerable haemorrhage ensued, and the physicians despaired of his life. Dr. Arndt, who had marked the precise time of the preceding scene of the somnambulism of this lady, found that it was exactly on the day, and at the hour, when the accident happened to her father. " This," observes the Doctor, " could not have been the mere effect of chance ; and, assuredly, there was no concert nor deceit on the part of the observer."

>In looking over the trials of those unfortunate persons who were condemned for sorcery and witchcraft, it is impossible to escape the conviction that the sorcerers or wizards exercised a truly magnetic influence over their credulous disciples. Far be it from me to strain the interpretation of the facts in favour of magnetism ; I am myself surprised to find the evidence so clear, so full, and so conclusive.* The persons who were so affected will be found to have exhibited all the phenomena of magnetic somnambulism, complete physical insensibility, convulsions, sometimes partial, sometimes general, sleep-talking, clairvoyance, prevision, and it is certainly not at all surprising that effects so extraordinary should in this age of darkness have been ascribed to demoniacal possession. Furthermore, on the part of those who professed these supposed satanic arts, it will appear manifest, that in the exercise of their skill, they discovered the development of a power within themselves to affect others, of which they were originally unconscious, and which confirmed them in the idea of their being really endowed with supernatural power, so that many who commenced their career as conjuring impostors, eventually died the victims of a faith, which neither the terrors of the scaffold nor the stake could induce them to repudiate. In confirmation of these views I now proceed to adduce cases, many of which indeed require no commentIn the year 1599, a girl named Martha Brossier, of Romorantin, in Berry, was reputed to be possessed, and excited a considerable sensation in Paris. At the suggestion of the right reverend the bishop of Paris, the king ordered a committee, composed of the most eminent physicians, to examine and report on her case. The physicians appointed were Marescot, Ellain, Haulin, Riolan, and Duet ; and their report, which is exceedingly curious, will be found translated into English by Abraham Hartwel.* The dedication to his majesty — I quote from this English translation — proceeds thus :— " Sir, by the commandmant of your majestie wee have set down briefely and truly that which we have found in our visiting of Martha Brossier We present the same unto your majestie without any art, without any painted show, without nourish, but with a naked simplicitie, the faithful companion of truth, which you have desired from us in this matter, and which in every other matter you have always loved and curiously sought." The report then continues, e< We, the undersigned Doctors Regents in the facultie of physicke, in the Universitie of Paris, touching the matter of Martha Brossier, a maide of the age of two-and-twenty yeres, or thereabouts, born at Romorantin, in Berry, who was brought unto us in the chappel of my Lord of Saint Geneufue and who we saw sometimes in constitution, countenance, and speech, as a person sounde of bodie and minde, do say in our consciences, and certify that which followeth ; that all which is before set down, [referring to the character of her fits] must be referred to one of these three causes, sicknesse, counterfeiting, or diabolicall possession."

>After the revocation of the edict of Nantes, the protestants, it is well known, were, throughout France, subjected to the most unrelenting persecution, and were massacred in great numbers. The peasants among the Cevennes mountains wandered about in the open air, enduring every description of privation and misery ; they held secret conferences for religious purposes, and many became excited into a state of ecstacy, which was characterised by all the phenomena of magnetic somnambulism. They were seized with vehement tremblings and convulsions ; hence they were called the Trembleurs des Cevennes ; they preached and prophesied, and spoke in a variety of foreign languages. It is remarkable that this epidemic prevailed principally among men ; but women also were affected by it, and even children of a tender age.* Jurieu, in his Pastoral Letters, states that they had all the appearance in their ecstacy of being in a profound sleep ; the sensibility of the body was completely lost, so that they were not even sensible to the pain of being burned : those who had only an imperfect knowledge of the French language in their ordinary state, expressed themselves with facility and purity ; many prayed and prophesied in a wonderful manner; and on recovering, none of them recollected anything which had during the paroxysm occurred.

>99. M. Lucas, the person interested at the foregoing sitting, returned a few days after to ask me if I had heard anything new respecting his brother-in-law. I had not paid any attention to the matter. The mother of the lost man accompanied M. Lucas, and asked me if I could give her a sitting. I made a slight objeclion, because I was hoMing a conference with several persons ; but, on the observation of M. Lucas, who told me that this lady had come several leagues expressly to obtain fresh information, and that the coach was waiting for her, I begged the persons present to excuse me, and judge of the experiment about to take place. Adele, once asleep, said, " I see him." — " Where do you see him ?" " Here, present." — *' Give us once more a description of him, as also of the place where he is." " He is a fair man, browned by the heat of the sun ; very corpulent, features pretty regular, hazel eyes, mouth large, air sombre and meditative. He is in the garb of a working man — a sort of small blouse ; as at the last time, he is at work, gathering seeds like enough to peppercorns, but I don't think they are, as they seem bigger. This seed is found in small shrubs ab jut three feet hicrh. I see a nesrro near, who is doing the same thing." — " Try and obtain an answer to-day ; let him tell you the name of the country where you see him." "He won't answer me." — " Tell him that it is his good mother whom he was so fond of, who is with you, and bids you inquire after him." " Oh ! at the name of his mother he turned round and said to me, ' My mother ! I shall not die before seeing her again; comfort her, and tell her that I am always thinking of her; I a.m not dead!'" — "Why does he not write to herl" *' He has written to her, but no doubt the vessel was wrecked ; at least he presumes so, as he received no answer. He tells me that he is at Mexico : he followed the emperor, Don Pedro ; was five years a prisoner, sufiered much, and will make every effort to return to Fiance ; they will see him again." — " Can he name the place he lives in ?" " No, it is far up in the country ; such places have no names." — " Is he with a European ?'* " No, with a man of color." — " Why does he not write to his mother 1" *' Because where he is no vessels come; he knows not to whom to apply ; then, again, he scarcely ever knew how to write, and now less than ever ; no one near him can render him this service, no one speaks his language ; he has much pains in making himself understood ; withal, he never was of an open or communicative disposition ; he has a somewhat unsociable look. It is a hard malter to get a word out of him; one would thirdc he was dumb." — " In short, how manage to write to him or hear from him ?" " He can't tell ; all he can say is, ' I am in Mexico, I am not dead, they'll see me again.' " — " Why did he thus forsake his parents without saying a word to them, since he was happy with them 1" " This man was far from being communicative ; he scarcely ever spoke, was very fond of his mother, but had not the same affection for his father, who was a stern, sour kind of man, and often used him roughly. The cup had long been filled up to the brim ; it was not the slight altercation he had with his father, the night before his departure, that induced him to leave : it was a plan decided on long before; he communicated it to no one, and started off stealthily. Having embraced them all over night, he sneaked off the next morning, without saying a word. Make yourself easy, madam, you will see him again." The good woman melted into tears as she recognised the truthfulness of each detail given her by Adele ; she had not a word to retrench from this description ; the character, the instruction, and the departure of her son, were precisely such as Adele described ; but what gives an air of greater probability to the clairvoyante's recital as to the country he lives in, is, that some of his relatives entertained the idea that he had enlisted into Don Pedro's army, and took steps at that time to acquire a certainty of it. M. Lucas furnished me with this particular some time after wlien on a visit to Paris : no information, however, could be obtained in this respect. What no less contributed to astonish this good woman, as well as M. Lucas and the person present at this curious sitting, was to see Adele, who, to screen herself from the burning rays of the sun of these countries, put her hand up to the left side of her face as if suffocating with heat ; but the most marvellous part of the scene was that she received a violent coup-de-soleil, that rendered all this side of her face, from the forehead to the shoulder, of a reddish blue, while the other side remained perfectly white ; and full twentyfour hours elapsed before this deep color commenced disappearing. The heat was so violent there for a moment, that it was impossible to keep one's hand on it. Present at this sitting was M. Haranger Pirlot, formerly a magnetizer, and honorably known for more than thirty years in the magnetic world. He told me that he never saw the like of this. The good woman took her leave quite consoled, unable to account to herself how that her son, who was in Mexico, could be between her and Adele, and how the latter could have received a coup-de-soleil when nobody felt the heat, the weather that day being very gloomy. I am not more advanced than she, and believe that many others in our place will be like us. We submit this question to the learned ; awaiting their answer, let us pass on to another sitting.

>137. Madame Vedeaux, for fifteen years a student of magnetism, finding herself momentarily at Paris, desires to avail herself of this opportunity of paying a visit to several clairvoyant subjects. She took a sitting at a young person's, whose clairvoyance she had been previously enabled to judge of. To a question put by this lady, the clairvoyante replied : *' I know but one somnambulist in Paris who can give you a solution to the question you ask : go to No. 17 Rue Tiquetonne ; you will find there a subject surrounded by angels and departed spirits that direct her, so that she is much more elevated than I am." Acting upon this advice, the lady came and asked me for a distant-view sitting. I did not promise her a clairvoyance of the first order, such views not being Adele's speciality, and not having for the moment any subject at my disposition. Agreeably to the wishes of my fair visiter, I begged Adele to look over this lady's property, and tell us whether there was any hidden treasure there. She replied thus : *' I see some water, apparently, to me, in a cistern ; it is dark ; then a turret, not unlike a dove-cot. It is contiguous to a house that stands by itself, and surrounded with fields. There is a room on the ground-floor with two windows ; on the first floor there is a room which also has two windows. This house is three stories high ; the main building has two wings, with which there is a communication by the staircases and corridors where the turret stands; it is quite a small room, in which I see a spirit wandering : it is a person who was murdered there a verylong time ago." Adele shrinks back in affright : I quiet her and she says that she is dragged toward a small store-room on the ground-floor, in which she can scarcely stand upright ; she sees there some wine, and declares that under this spot has been hidden a treasure contained in a small strong box, in which she perceives jewels, silver, and plate. She goes on giving descriptions, superfluous for the reader to know, but very agreeable for this lady to hear. The day after this sitting, the lady returned to acquaint me that she had. been again to see her somnambulist, who held with her, as near as may be, this discourse : " You ought to be satisfied with the clairvoyante I made you acquainted with. 1 fear but one thing, which is, that her lucidity should deprive me of your kind visits, for I am very much attached to you ; it was to give you a proof of this that I feared not making you acquainted with another clairvoyante more powerful than myself. I perceive that she spoke to you of a spirit that wandered. about the property she visited, the result of a murder : that is very true ; I see it also. It is a pity that this clairvoyante should be too reserved and too much afraid of telling us all she sees ; there would be moments wherein she would confound the most incredulous. She is too fearful of committing mistakes ; her magnetizer ought to know that." I replied to this lady, that it was true that if Adele was a little less afraid of committing mistakes, she would be capable of greater things. It is her reserve that proves her lucidity ; she is aware how pictures which present themselves to the eye may lead to error, seeing that they represent the past, present, and future, as present, although in the world of causes, wherein are perceived the various states of their manifestation, there can be no errors: however, they are possible in their material efl*ects, which are or are not manifested. If man studied with great attention this somnambulic or spiritual state, which he yet knows but imperfectly, he would not be so ready to inveigli against errors, especially if unable to verify the revelations of the clairvoyantes. I have spoken of this curious sitting merely to have an opportunity of repeating what I have already said in the first volume, that it was not necessary to guide clairvoyantes, step by step, toward the object we desire to have visited by them ; for Adele, at this sitting, formed no communication with the lady : she asked for the chateau, and it forthwith appeared. What has made me thus act, is, that knowino- a clairvoyante able to find out the traces of an object stolen or lost, of a person missing, &c., in these researches, he can be guided by no human thought ; the desired object, therefore, must present itself at the call of the clairvoyante, or the latter must proceed toward it without any itinerary. It may then, I say to myself, be the sam.e with all views at a distance ; of this I have obtained proof a hundred times. Even yesterday, a doctor of high repute, who believes in magnetism because he is so under my influence that I force him to confess it (whenever he seems disposed to deviate from the truth) that he can offer no opposition to my closing his eyes, for instance, if I will it, until he begs of me to open them for him (and he does not sleep) — he was in the same disposition of mind with regard to somnambulism and views at a distance, when yesterday, as I was saying, I somnambulized my little Emile, and intrusted him to the doctor to question him at his ease. Out of more than forty answers, he raised doubts only on two or three made by a spirit whom he caused to be questioned at a distance. His surprise was not less great when I assured him that the really living person whose spirit responded to that of my little clairvoyante, of twelve years of age, knew nothing of this little secret intriguing and those confidences, in which, however, he would have taken good care not to compromise himself by answers injurious to him. The doctor, before taking the hand of the clairvoyante, had already a description of the house into which he had sent him. On this simple invitation from me to the child : " The doctor desires that you should see a house into which he wishes you to enter." " I see it," forthwith said the child, " it is a new house," &c. This method of proceeding would not bo admissible unless it succeeded as well as the other; but is it not demonstrated by the aforementioned experiment for researches, thefts, &c., so common in our days 1 What makes me more attached to these experiments is, that I wish to prove, that if an object unknown to the clairvoyante presents itself to his view, agreeably to his wishes — if actions passed like those attending all the circumstances of a theft, or the journey of a person whose trace has been lost, present themselves to him — I say, the person who has done or produced these actions, must exist equally as well as those actions which appear to our material eyes completely dead ; and the soul which has produced such thinffs can no more refuse to come, at the call of the clairvoyante, than these scenes refuse appearing. I wish also to observe, that the clairvoyante who addressed Madame Devaux has not the least knowledge of Adele in her watchful state, and the same may be said of Adele with regard to her. I will say, moreover, that in the view at distance Adele took, it must be observed that she declares it impossible for her to stand upright in the store-room, which really is, as this lady has said, too small to admit of her doing so materially. It is, therefore, not the view alone that goes toward that spot — it is the whole spiritual individual, as I have already remarked at the commencement of this volume, in my answer to magnetizers who believe that apparitions are a transmission of thoughts, and as I have proved in the view Adele took of Mexico, in which she received a coup-de-soleil (though it was rainy weather). It can not be for a moment doubted but that the clairvoyante is wholly in the places he visits at a distance, although answering our questions by the organs of his material body, as if still within it. If, perchance, it should be arg-ued that he sees these thing-s in the thought of the questioner, although the contrary is mathematically proved by the details present, which he gives you of places you have not seen for many years, and the changes that have taken place since your departure ; these details can not be in your thoughts, since you are not acquainted with them, and ulterior information only proves to you their reality. This is a logical proof, admitting of no reply ; but, as there are persons who have a reply for all, and who, prejudiced in their belief of the transmission of thoughts, see but it, I beg them to tell me how a clairvoyante can walk about in the least of their thoucrhts, which represents a place capable of containing thousands of spirits similar to the one visiting them. If I ask a solution of this from these savans, it is less to combat the truth of it than to fix for an instant their vast conception on this explanation, by which they believe they have nothing more to reply. I will tell them that it deserves a little more attention, and can not, though really existing, answer the question I address to them. Does the clairvoyante see only what you have seen or thought? Certainly not ; since every day you obtain proofs of the contrary. In that case, then, where does he see these things 1 Where they are, no doubt. And they are, where we suppose them materially to be, far from us. If they are far from us, and the spirit goes to visit them, in body and not in sight — as it is easy for you to make sure of— who can convey it to these places, the doors being shut, and the walls well cemented ? Answer, I say to you. Is it the places that come to your clairvoyante 1 Who brings these places into your room ? I puzzle you a little more than I shall be puzzled, in answering you that the soul, disengaged from matter, has no more difficulties to encounter in coming at your request than the clairvoyante experiences in going unseen by your material eyes to those remote places, or than those places have in coming to you.

>" Having thus conferred together, and resolved upon treating the subject seriously, remove from the patient all such persons as might annoy you, and keep none but the necessary witnesses (one only, if possible,) in the room. Then prepare yourself so as to be neither too warm nor too cold, and to enjoy perfect freedom in your gestures ; you should also take your precautions not to be interrupted during the sitting. These preliminaries arranged, seat your patient as conveniently as possible, and place yourself opposite to him, on a seat rather more elevated than his, so as to hold his knees between yours, and to touch your feet with his own. Request him to give himself up, to think of nothing, and not to distract his attention by examining the effects he may experience ; to be full of hope, and not to be uneasy or alarmed, should the magnetic influence produce in him momentary pains. After having composed yourself, hold his thumbs between your fingers, so that the inside of your thumbs may touch the inside of his, and fix your eyes upon him. You may remain from two to five minutes in this position, or until you feel that your thumbs and his are at the same temperature. This being done, you must withdraw your hands, by moving them outwardly right and left, so that the inward surface be turned outwards, and raise them as high as the head ; you must then lay them on both shoulders, and leave them there for about one minute ; then bring them down along the arms to the extremity of the fingers, touching slightly all the way. You will repeat this manipulation five or six times, keeping your hands off the body when you raise them. You will then hold your hands above the head for a moment, and draw them down before the face, at a distance of about two inches, as low as the pit of the stomach. Here you will stop again for about two minutes, laying your thumbs on the pit of the stomach, and your fingers under the ribs. You will then slowly come down the body as low as the knees. These manipulations should be repeated during the greater part of the sitting. You will also occasionally come nearer to the patient, so as to lay your hands behind his shoulders, and bring them slowly down the spine, and thence over the hips and along the thighs, down to the knees or to the feet. When you wish to bring the sitting to a close, you must take care to draw the magnetic fluid to the extremities of the hands and feet, by lengthening your line of motion beyond these extremities, each time shaking your fingers. Lastly, you will make before the face, and even before the breast, a few transverse manipulations, at a distance of three or four inches. It is essential to magnetise invariably downward from the head toward the extremities, and never upwards from the extremities towards the head. The downward manipulations are magnetic, — that is, they are accompanied with the intention of magnetising. The movements made upwards are not so. When the magnetiser operates upon the magnetisee, they are said to be en rapport — which means a peculiar and acquired disposition, by virtue of which the magnetiser exerts an influence upon the magnetisee ; in other words, a communication of vital principle is^established between them ; and when this has once taken place, the magnetic action is renewed at every subsequent sitting, the instant the operation begins."

>6. On a mentor, who superintends their education; Ai's had told me in a former sitting, that a saint instructed them. This child is so lively that he scarcely awaits the answers made him ; to this may bo attributed the mistake he made as to the decease of the father of Ais. We see by M. Swedenborg, as by M. Mallet, that a number consists of 20. 7. There is also accord as to the coronation. 8. As to the festivals. 9. As to the possible union and caresses of two children. 10. As to their belief, in communicating with each other, through speech ; this, also, Emile had told me, when, on the contrary, it is through thought, through sensation. Here, then, are ten secrets in which they perfectly agree. It is necessary to observe that I did not magnetize this child once in two months, his mother having an objection to it. We may judge what facility is prepared for somnambulists in communicating with the deceased, especially when rightly brought up for this purpose, and prU' dently guided in this speciality. I return to an observation to which I did not give sufficient importance : that is, to prepare the questions we desire to address, not to suffer ourselves to be led away by those raised by the answers we obtain; keep them for the next sitting, you will have had time to reflect on them, and prepare them better. They may, sometimes, accord with others that have preceded them, which would be a needless repetition, for we have been enabled to appreciate that an answer very often contains several solutions ; hence it is, that at the first sitting, Binet used to say to me : " You have already been answered that question." — I did not believe it; I had not comprehended him, and I found at a later period that he was right. Such conversations, likewise, present in the reading a void which is, at times, painful. It will be understood that this is not a history whose every detail should be consigned with harmony and a certain elegance of style, in order to arailse. Here we instruct ourselves, pick up information in the road of the infinite, the unknown, to construct the universal history of creation and the human destination. We are but a very poor workman for a monument so colossal. A skilful architect will one day come to unite these materials, and adorn with them the edifice at which we have been courageously working for so many years. Many questions, also, are found unanswered ; the spirit, no doubt, perceiving that our intelligence is not open to such revelations. It is silent — and we insist not. "We ask for the spiritual obole with humility, and stop in time when we find that we are importunate.

>Many magnetizers are easily enough disgusted with somnambulism ; good somnambulists are always useful to consult; it is very frequently the magnetizers who disorganize them by the strangeness of their questions. We should be convinced, once for all, that it is necessary to train every somnambulist to one speciality, suited to his tastes and the kind of instruction we desire. How conceive that a somnambulist should answer at the same sitting questions hurried, and so little in accord as these : " Can you tell me what I have in my pocket V* ** Can you read this letter?" " Can you see where I suffer?" " Can you tell me what my brother is doing in Africa V* " Can you see whether I shall gain such a law-suit V " Can you tell what such a person thinks of me ?" " Will the lotteryticket I have purchased turn up a prize?" " Can you tell me what has become of my husband, whom I have not seen these twenty years ?" and a thousand other like questions. The world thinks that a somnambulist who sees and knows a certain thing can see and know all. The magnetizer himself is no less insatiable. Consider that mistakes must be the consequence of such a mode of operating ; too many are often made even in following a route with great circumspection. What can we expect from such a chaos of questions ? Deception for all, shame and vexation for the magnetizer, and insanity or stupidity for the somnambulist thus tortured ; fortunate for him if physical tortures be not added to moral ones. I am not at all surprised that somnambulism should lose in the public mind its sacred and divine character. You wish to learn so much from it that you know nothing. If, in spiritual researches, we were to proceed in this way, we should obtain but very little. It is necessary, as I have said, to write down beforehand the questions we intend putting — acquaint the clairvoyante with them, that he may prepare for them. These questions should be clear and few in number, touching only on one subject, with no objections, and thus terminating the sitting. The answers obtained will supply new questions for the following sitting. Never make two similar experiments at the same sitting y if you would succeed ; no pride, no interested calculation. Be jDatient, kind. The stone that caused your fall to-day should warn you to pick out a better road. It is for you to guide your clairvoyante in it carefully and firmly.

>52. " When you rise, through ecstasy, toward heaven, the sensation you experience is, I suppose, similar to that experienced by a person dying." " No ; I rise in good health, experience no obstacle, whereas at death, the soul is much more cramped in quitting the body disorganized by illness ; then there is sufFeringr, but I feel none in the state I am." — " WTiat effect is produced in you when you behold beneath you the earth, which must appear very obscure compared to the brilliant light of heaven V " We make no reflections; we neither think of the earth nor of any one ; we rise in a sensation of happiness, of joy impossible to describe, we would wish to remain there." — " May it not be an error of your senses this pretended elevation toward heaven, or rather an interior nervous expansion, illumed by bright electric rays surrounding the soul, which, possibly is, in its corporeal interior, and enjoys the happiness of this sight which it fancies it tastes from without." " How admit such an error, when one feels as I feel, sees what I see ; traverses clouds, space, and arrives in the midst of relations, friends, who all stretch out to you their arms, overwhelm you with caresses, and seek by all possible means to prove to you the pleasure they feel in seeing you, and desire with a common accord that you should soon rejoin them. If we look upon all this as error, I know not then how we are to recognise truth." — '* There are narcotics which produce hallucinations more or less agreeable, and display to us pictures, scenes, somewhat similar to ecstasy, and such, however, are errors." *' There you are again at discussion and doubt. It is a practice with men to treat as erro7's what they do not comprehend ; it is an easy way of settling the matter. Narcotics convey trouble into the nervous system, disturb the soul in its vital fnnctions, throw it into the world of causes, when it makes unheard-of efforts to remain in the world of effects. The soul confounds the domain of the memory ; the pictures of the ineffaceable actions which all men have within them, with the pictures of the world of causes in which it wanders for a moment. It can perceive in this state the most burlesque scenes tacked on to rational ones ; because it knows not how to separate them, knows not where it is, knows not what they are; the reservoir of its imagination overflows, and hurries it into the absurd. But is it the same in ecstasy : is all that I tell you under the empire of folly ? What is predicted to me and which is accomplished, is it of the domain of error ? The views at distances, the descriptions of places : what is done or said there ; are they errors ; All the somnambulists who thus see do they not prove that they are no longer in their body, since they reproduce to you facts, scenes, conversations of which you have never heard speak, and which take place for the first thxie at the very instant they are communicated to you. What can you say to those facts ? Be reasonable, then, and believe that all the savans in the world can not deny what I have just cited, and which is operated every day at each instant; they will be obliged to extend the properties of the body, if they are unwilling to give it a soul, and these properties will be as obscure in their solution as those of the soul, or they will accept the latter j then they will give it the power of travelling out of the body, reading thouo-hts, seeing actions past and future, and when they have acknowledged such a soul, they will not refuse its going in search of repose to a place of recompense for all the sufferings which it has endured in this world of grief." — " I thank you for your inoenious and frank explanation. I have nothing to say against it." 53. " Once more, allow me to make an observation on the last sitting. My reason for doubting that your soul was out of your body, is, that scarcely have I spoken, than you answer me ; and I do not perceive your body making any movement when you say that you are receiving the caresses of your relatives." " It is, however, this want of movement in my body, in my grand ecstatic movements, which ought to prove to you that I am no longer in it ; when my relatives, on the contrary, come on earth to see me, you perceive my spiritual hand pressin<r theirs, my body gesticulating, because they are really there present and I also ; but when I am in heaven, my body can no longer make the same gestures, since there is no longer a soul within it. If I answer you immediately, it is because I still cling to my body by sympathetic threads which you seem to me to hold like cords, forcing me, when you draw them, to descend to the power of your will." — " In views, at distances, although the somnambulists are in other places, their body is not deprived of movement." " The comparison holds not good. They are on earth at slight distances comparatively with those of heaven; they are not in the ecstatic condition necessary to communicate with heaven, and hence the separation of the soul and body is not the same." — I perceive that Adele purposes entering into the ecstatic state j I make up my mind to try a decisive experiment, and leave her to her will ; I forthwith send Bruno to sleep, put him en rapport with her, and beg him to follow her as far as possible, recommending him not to be alarmed, and to warn me only if he should see danger. I wished to be assured by myself of the pretended dangers of ecstasy. Frequently had Adele told me that she had been on the point of not coming back to re-enter her body, and as I thought that she only wanted to alarm me, I wished to know what opinion to come to. At the lapse of a quarter of an hour, Bruno exclaims in great alarm, ** I have lost sighfof her!" I had relied upon him, and paid little attention to Adele, whose body in the meanwhile had grown icy cold ; there was no longer any pulse or respiration ; her face was of a sallow green, her lips blue, her heart gave no sign of life. I placed before her lips a mirror, but it was by no means tarnished by them. I magnetized her powerfully, in order to bring back her soul into her body, but for five minutes my labor was vain. Bruno, alai'med at my want of success, as well as the persons present at this sitting, tended greatly to disturb me. I thought for a moment that the work was consummated, and that I had an indubitable proof that the soul had departed from her body. I was obliged to request the persons present to pass into another room, in order that I might recover by myself a little energy. At the lapse of a few moments, I entertained the hope that I should not have such a misfortune to deplore ; but, physically speaking, I was utterly powerless. Falling on my knees, I asked back of God, in my prayer, the soul that I had in my doubts suffered to depart. I seemed, by an effect of intuition to know that my prayer was heard : after a minute's further anguish, I obtained these words : *' Why have you called me back % it was all over with me ! but God moved at your prayer, sent me back to you. No more shall I be permitted to return to heaven; I am punished." — "Of what punishment do you speak?" "Raphael has forbidden my mother and all my relations, except Alphonse, to come and see me again, until further orders, and it is to you that I am indebted for this privation. I shall no longer be able to ascend to heaven, but had it not been for you I should have been there now and for ever." It may be naturally supposed that I paid bat little attention to her complaints and reproaches.

>65. The abbe said to me, " You will have the goodness to ask, at the next sitting, for M, De Mallet (Christophe Edouard), and send me word whether he appeared, and in what condition." I much doubted this experiment, for which we had. so little information to work upon. I asked for him, however, and, to my great satisfaction he appeared. I ask ihis gentleman if he will be good enough to answer a few questions which the abbe desires to put to him V " Yes," replied he ; I told him that at the first sitting they would discourse together ; meanwhile I beg Adele to give me a description of this gentleman. *' He is a priest, or, at least, he wears the costume of one ; a black robe, without surplice : he is a litrle taller than the abbe, stout in proportion ; he has a noble countenance, a prominent nose, the nostrils somewhat pinched up ; he has a mark on his cheek, under the left eye ; his hair is gray, and he may be sixty." — " Are you quite sure that he has a mark on his left cheek, under the eye ?" — '* Yes, it is evident enough." " What kind of mark, a pockmark ?" — " I can not see because he is a pretty good distance off; but I am certain that he has a mark of some kind." This gentleman retires. Adele is afraid that the abbe should raise any difficulties as to this apparition, and says that she won't ask for any more if she has been deceived.

>73. M. Demarest, Eliza's husband, came the next day, according to appointment. I magnetized Adele. He then said to me, " I lost a sister, whose name I hand you ; be so kind as to request her attendance." " Here she is." — " Give me a description of her ]" said he. (He was not en rapport with Adele.) The latter replied, " She is rather taller than this gentleman, her brother ; her hair is of a dark flaxen color, her face is long, and she has large blue eyes of a very sweet expression." On the observation of M. Demarest, as to whether Adele has a good view of her eyes, the latter draws nearer to her the gentleman's sister, and says that " the right eye seems to her as if somewhat dimmed." " It is a web," said this gentleman, " that grew in her eye, in consequence of an accident." — " Her mouth is small," resumes Adele, " skin very white, complexion pale, but the cheeks are somewhat flushed like those of consumptive persons, and her deportment is melancholy." Adele feels conscious that she must have been dearly loved on earth, and she reckons her about eighteen years of age. There is in her voice something sweet, but drawling. She tells her brother that their father, supposed by those around him to be on his death-bed, sixty leagues from Paris, was out of danger ; that he should be consoled for tlie loss of Eliza ; that she herself appeared to him expressly to convince him of the reality of another existence after death. She was accompanied by a young girl whom her brother could not recognise from the description given of her by Adele, and whom his sister said was one of her old school friends. M. Demarest acknowledged all the details of the description as exact apart the age, which Adele gave her as an approximation to the real one, his sister being twenty-one when she died ; apart, the color of the hair, which, said he, was of a chestnut color; Adele saw it of a dark flaxen; then again the eye, which she had not discovered at once, inasmuch as this person was on one side and at a distance from Adele ; the rest was very exact, even to the revelation of the recovery of their father, which they did not hear of till some days afterward. Would it be believed, these three facts sufficed M. Demarest to doubt the reality of the apparition. A somnambulist who makes a mistake of three years in the appreciation of age, and this gentleman declares that his sister was not that age ; then again, as to a shade more or less dark of the hair, and a slight delay in the discovery of a web in the eye ! this is sufficient for this man to doubt so detailed an apparition ; all the other particularities, even to the tone of her voice, are strictly exact; her father, whom he thought dead, and whose recovery was announced to him, sufficed not this uneasy and suspicious man ; as much less was required to make me believe, and I had been as far off as he from siicb persuasions. I will observe that at the sitting he believed, and was greatly astonished; it was only at a later period that these facts disappeared from his memory to inake way for these three trifling objections * We can not say, after such a sitting, that Adele saw or read his thoughts, had it been so they would have agreed as to the age, the color of the hair ; and, above all, the eye, which was the most distinctive sign of the apparition, would have been cited first. Men of right understanding, who consider well of this apparition, will, I think, come to a different conclusion, particularly if I inform them that I had a little somnambulist, ten years of age (he will be seen hereafter), possessing the speciality of views at distances, who one day, placed en rajjport with this M. Demarest, and visiting his abode, made the remark that he saw on a small table a blue surtout. M. Demarest would not accept this view, because, instead of a surtout it was a paletot. A small sou of ten centimes, no longer circulated but for a Hard, being put in a box, the child says, *' I see a Hard," whereupon this gentleman exclaimed, '* This child is not asleep ; he knows not what he says."

>I repeated to him what I said in my introduction, that " I should deem mj'self the most coDtempiible being on earlh if I specuUited on such falselioods. All that I recounted was the sacred trulh." He then said to me : " Would you be so kind as to give me a sitting?" I eagerly ofFeted fo gratify his wish. Adeie visited (spiritually) his daughter and wife, who could not for a single moment doubt her excellent clairvoyance. Madame Mirande can not make use of the thumb of her rififht hand. Adele asked her if she had not magnetized some one 1 This lady replied that she was acquainted with magnetism only by name; but that from what she had seen Adele do, when showing M. Mirande how he should magnelize his daughter, whose arm is paralyzed, she recollected that a doctor had once taught lier how to perform frictions on the arm of one of her friends who had lost the use of it. She had rendered her this service for nearly a. fortnight; but finding that it fatigued her and gave her pains in the thumb, she left off; and it is only since then that her thumb has been in this state. Adele said to her : *' It was magnetism that you performed then ; the doctor ought to have warned you to shake your finsrers to disensfaoe yourself from the bad fluid you absorbed, and wash your hands in water acidulated with vinegar, as I recommend your husband to do after each magnetization." This lady acknowledged that Adele's was a just observation, since her thumb was not in this state previous to the above time, and that she had received no blow or any injury that could have occasioned what she felt. (A warning to those who do not believe in the transmission of disease.) M. Mirande, from the first sitting of somnambulism he had ever seen, was convinced of the reality of what was said with respect to maladies. But he wished to know what opinion to come to as to the revelations of the " Secrets ;" consequently he begged Adele to ask for the apparition of his brother, whom he believed killed in the Russian campaign. Adele, not seeing him in the spiritual world, said that he was not dead; that she saw him on earth. She gave the following description of him : "I see a tall stout man, with brown hair, fine black lively eyes, and of a tender expression; a mouth neither large nor small, beautiful teeth, nose well made, cheeks colored, air gracious, and very cheerful. He seems to me about thirty years of age, and is rather taller than M. Mirande. He wears the uniform of a sub-officer (I believe), because I see him with only one epaulette, blue coat, pantaloons of the same color, with scarlet edgings, shako with visor ; altogether he is a fine man." — "Ask him in what country he is]" "He does not know, or lie has no viind to tell me. He says that he has undergone much suffering. He was made a prisoner and sent to the very interior of Russia, in countries bordering on China, 1 believe ; he tells me that his brother will see him again." *' AVhy has he not written to him V " He did write, but the letters have either been lost or miscarried." — " Why does he no longer write 1" " He knows not whether his brother is still alive." — " Tell him that he is alive and takes upon himself to find out the place of his retreat." " He answers that he can not say when, but that he is in hopes, one day, of taking his brother by surprise." — " What does he do there ?" *' He is very comfortable, has lands of his own, turns them to account, and employs many persons. Could he have managed to dispose of his property, he would have been before this in France ; but thereabouts purchasers are not to be found as with us; he can't tell when he shall succeed in selling off." — " Let him write to his brother." " He has no opportunity. You think it an easy matter ; he is very far from the sea ; then again he has a wish to take his brother by surprise, when he returns, rich and happy. He is not selfish, he has an excellent heart, but he is not free from ambition ; he always was ambitious. He has dreamed of only one thing in his life, — being rich in his old days, and he is at the height of his wishes." — " Is he married V* ** Yes ; but he has no children. Next time I will beg him to show me the country he lives in, as well as his house and wife." Adele is fatigued, and desires to be roused. M. Miranda asks for further particulars as to the costume of his brother. Adele repeats what she has already said, and adds that " she believes she saw gold lace on his breast, what we call hrandehourgs ; she likewise thinks that he had white facings to his coat." M. MiraTide acknowledcred that all the details as to the personal appearance were exact, as well as those in respect to the character, and so forth, of his brother. The brother of this gentleman had served in the departmental guard, previous to the Russian campaign. M. Mirande believes that such was the costume, only he did not know that he was a sub-officer. He is much surprised that his brother, who must be fifty-six years old, should look no more than thirty. Adele makes the observation to him that she sees him at the moment he left France. "At that time," replies M. Mirande, "he was not above oneand-twenty. He looks to you full thirty ; no doubt the fatigue he underwent made him grow old soon." Adele resumes : " As you knew him only a soldier of one-and-twenty, he appears to me an officer, and older. Several years may have elapsed since that time and the moment I see him. This is very admissible. If I beheld him at the age one-and-twenty, it would be said that I see in the thought. If, on the contrary, I saw him at the age he is now, fifty-six, his brother would not recognise him." M. Mirande can very well understand this. He has not the least doubt but that it was his brother who appeared. Ho can not recover his astonishment. I will add, as a reflection to this apparition: 1. If Adele had seen this man in M. Mirande's thought, she would have seen him as a private soldier, about twenty-one years of age. 2. It would have been sufficient for her to have given this gentleman a few particulars, then to have broken off with the observation that his brother was dead. Such was M. Mirande's opinion. Adele, on the contrary, gives details as to the existence and life of this man; she makes judicious observations. If she saw him at his present age, and in his present dress and occupations, his brother could never have recognised him. The only objection admissible is, that he ought to have given the name of the place he lives in. It remains to know whether he is able or willing to do so. To be able, this place must have a name; and all the countries of the globe are not like France, where each hamlet is dependent on a city, this city on a department, &c. Those uncultivated, remote countries, but little known to geography, possess not names so easy to class as with us. We experienced the same difficulty in our perception of Mexico. Then, again, if this man is unwilling to acquaint us with the place he lives in, for reasons of his own, we can not force him. He evades the question by saying : " I have been a prisoner; I have written ; I have no opportunity; I know not whether my brother is still living," &c. The future will tell us more about it. This apparition proves to us that if men still on earth can appear in the dress, the features, and age, they no longer have, souls disengaged from matter may surely have the same power ; and we acquire the certitude, by this fact, that all that I have said, in this respect, is correct. Each garment, each year, imprints an ineffaceable image on our bodies, which may be found again, at all times, agreeably to the desire of the spirit. I have made this experiment several times ; I have asked for persons living on earth at different periods of their life ; they have appeared at the age demanded, clad in the costume they then wore. I have made inquiries of them, and obtained the assurance that this was correct. I was far from having known these persons when of the age at which I asked for them. In somnambulism, there is a continual source of observation. To succeed we must not argue ; we must study — not believe without pi oofs, and not deny without knowing. I will even go so far as to say that we have no right to deny what we can not comprehend.

>107. Adele is not apprized of E mile's sitting. I have prepared the following questions, which I beg her to submit to M. Swedenborg ; " The two beings created for each other, are they in every respect alike as to physiognomy ?" " No, they are only exactly similar as to affections." — " May one be a white and the other a black ?" " Yes." — " Can a white be united to a negress V " Yes." — " Do negroes preserve their black complexion in heaven ?" " In heaven all men are white ; it is only on earth, from the effect of climate, that they are of different colors." — " When blacks reappear on earth, do they resume their black color ?" " Yes, it must be so, otherwise they would not be recognised." — " Negroes among each other do ihey see themselves black, if such is their affection'?" «' There are no negroes who like their color. When they compare it with that of the whites, they envy the white color. They prefer us in all. Black women seek after white men, and black men after white women. They have no affection for their color, had they any they would be deprived of it in heaven where all men are white." — " Can a black child be united with a white child, each having died in its own color ?" " Yes." — *' Have children, among each other, books to study 1" " Those that desire it have them."—" Is each pair of children under the special care of a superior spirit charged with their instruction V *• The spirit charged with this instruction has not less than a number of children, and that number is twenty." — " What kind of instruction is given them V " That which God deems suitable." — " Are children crowned at a feast which is general with them ]" " There are religious festivals and usages in heaven as on earth ; but all children are generally crowned at the age of seven years." — " There are years, then, in heaven ?" " Time, as I have before said, is not reckoned there as on earth ; it is no longer a necessity, one is not obliged to put off till the morrow the desire which is satisfied as soon as formed ; the calculation of time becomes needless there. It is only for children still subject to the usages necessary to complete their instruction that time is counted." — " Children, from their earliest age, can they be united if they died at about the same time ?" " Yes, but they are not ultimately united before the age of fifteen years ; it is the age of eternal union." — "Can a child be ignorant of its having lived spiritually on another globe before appearing on earth ?" ** No one is ignorant of such existence ; it is for want of thought if some do not speak of it." — " Children perfected, do they caress each other by kisses or other demonstrations ?" " Yes : but their ordinary caress is shaking hands affectionately until they are ultimately united." — " There have appeared to us children who did not seem to have made any progress since their departure from the earth ; do they remain long in such state 1" " A time more or less long." — " Can they, like grown-up persons, remain an unlimited time in innocent pleasures V " Yes." — ■' Do children believe that they speak through speech or thought?" " They believe that they speak through speech." I had put this question to Emile's guide, and he answered me in the same sense. Having exhausted the questions I had prepared for this sitting, I was about to rouse Adele when she made a gesture of surprise, and tendered, with the greatest vivacity, her hand to some one who was near her, and caused her so powerful an emotion that she shed tears in abundance. "What creates in you this surprise 1" said I to her. " It is Alphonse." — " What ! Alphonse, who for so long a period has not paid you a visit 1" (About eighteen months.) " He, himself," replied she. — " Has he anything to tell you '?" " It seems to him, he says, but two days ago." — " He does not grow weary where he is." " I perceive as much." Adele expressed a wish to chat with this cherished brother; T left her a moment, but soon perceived that she was entering the complement of ecstasy. I felt her pulse, to guide myself by its pulsations, when I thought it time to recall her to earth ; 1 did so, and she obeyed me without a murmur, exclaiming : " Yes, our departure from this miserable globe, our descent into the grave, is the first step we take toward pei-fect equality ; fortune, title, grandeur, ugliness, deformity, grief, misery — all this passes under the spiritual level, and emerges from it, equalized for ever ; love, fraternily, replace egotism and ambition. Oh ! my God, wherefore men do they not appreciate thy divine mercy 1 wherefore dost thou send me back among them 1 My time is not ended, let us re-enter this prison and hope !" I had sacrificed this sitting, as I have said, to verify whether all that Emile's guide told me was correct; we have seen that there is accord : 1. As to the color of the hair, which may be different between two beings, as we have the proof direct in Ai's and his companion, hers being flaxen and his black. 2. As to the possible union of a white with a negress. 3. As to the disappearance of the black color in heaven, where all beings are white. 4. On the necessity of appearing on earth in the color we bore there. 5, On the possibility of having books in heaven, if children are fond of them.

>108. When I intrusted to the printer my manuscript of the " Secrets," I had not a duplicate of it, my employment permitting me not to copy such a work : I recommended it, therefore, to M. Mirande, director of the printing-office, harassed as I was by a secret inquietude, still further augmented by the somewhat unfavorable disposition of mind into which my prospectus had thrown certain members of different sects. Several of them having come to me for more ample information as to the religious tendency of this work, I had frankly answered them that my object was to tell all that had been revealed to me, without, in aught, perverting the meaning to the advantage of any particular belief. I agreed not with these gentlemen for two reason : 1. I believe God to be infinitely good — not subject to fits of vengeance and cruelty. 2. I believe that in all religions we might be saved. No more was necessary for these stupid and egotistical men to make them augur ill of the soundness of my work. One day a disciple of Swedenborg quitted me, saying : " Monsieur, with such disposition of mind, you can but have written your work under a very bad influence. It could not have been M. Swedenborg who came to you ; but I predict to you that in a few days he will appear in person to you yourself, to undeceive you and forbid you printing it." I answered this gentleman, that '• the day I should have the honor of such a visit would be one of the happiest of my life." He quitted me in a very bad humor, being unable to contain his displeasure before a lady present, who was a follower of Swedenborg, and worthy of respect fi'om her great age and enlightened understanding, the fruit of long and painful meditations. Matters stood thus. A vexatious idea came into my head, that if it were possible, certain persons inimical to this work might make away with it. One day I received a proof to correct, with a part of the manuscript, of which it was the reproduction. What was my surprise on seeing that twenty-six pages of the manuscript had been so burned that it was very difficult to read their contents : these pages were actually those containing all the revelations of M. Swedenborg. I was confounded. Next day M. Mirande came to my house : I begged him frankly to tell me, since this accident had been attended by no untoward results, whether it had occurred before, during, or after the com230sition. This gentleman replied that it happened before the composition, in the room of the reader. The latter was about looking over the manuscript ; some one came to speak to him ; he laid down this part on the top of his stove, which was very hot at that moment, and perceived his distraction only from a strong smell of burning; he instantly withdrew my manuscript, which, had it remained there a second lonsj'er, would have been annihilated. I knew not what to think of such an accident, when yesterday I asked M. Swedenborg the cause of it. He replied : " This accident was prepared by evil spirits, who wanted to annihilate the truths I have revealed to you." — " Is it to you that I am indebted for its non-execution V *' Let it suffice you to know that good spirits watched over its preservation, as they watch over yours and your claitvoyante's. Had these evil spirits the power, they would lay a spell on you. But fear not ; those who conceived such vengeance will be the first to read you, and will learn to repent of their error. You ought to remember that I came the morning after this accident, to assure you that your work would appear unshackled, for such is the will of God. Be calm : among my disciples, as in all religions, there are false men who pervert to their profit my writings ; but they will not succeed in establishing their doctrines." I did not exactly recollect, not having taken down the dale, whether M. Swedenborg: came to see Adele the morninsf after this accident ; but I still await the fulfilment of the prediction of his disciple, and I think that, after reading this work, he will be enabled to judge whether it has been dictated by the evil one, or l)y a beneficent spirit. I availed myself of the presence of M. Swedenborg to put to him the following question : " At the last sitting you explained to me how years were estimated in heaven ; but I did not perfectly comprehend your explanation : could you furnish me with a little additional information on this point]" "In heaven there are no years as on earth; I have told you that children dying before the age of seven years, were all crowned at that age, and those fifteen years old in like manner. I merely borrowed the word * years' as a figurative expression, to make myself understood by your clairvoyante, for in heaven they are degrees. The age of seven years represents the degree of knowledge ; that of fifteen the degree of love, and so on." Adele said to me : " It is true that M. Swedenborg always spoke to me of degrees; but, not comprehending these degrees, I begged him to explain this to me otherwise, in order that I might the better reproduce to you what he said to me ; for if I do not myself comprehend, how should I make you do so ? Then again, he told me that time was not reckoned in heaven, where all was by degrees of affection. On earth, children seven years of age, are, it is said, at the age of knowledge ; it is this want of knowledge that is crowned in heaven : the child, were it not to enter this degree till after twenty of our years, represents the child of seven years with us. It is the same with respect to the age of fifteen, when we feel on earth the first approaches of love. In heaven it is a degree — an affection similar to that of the child entering the state of knowledge. There is no limited time : when this affection enters the person, we say he is in the degree of love, which corresponds to the age of fifteen on our earth." I am aware that some of M. Swedenhorg's works treat of degrees, but I am not acquainted with them. (I leave the reader to judge of the revelations of this sitting, in respect to the accident that befell my manuscript.)

>Be strengthened more and more. M. B , desirous of concealing his name, out of family considerations, signed the duplicate of this sitting, to guaranty me in future against the reservations that some forgetful and wrangling men might raise as to the reality of what they have heard and acknowledged as true. Henceforth, I shall act in the same way. The morning after this sitting, M. B came to my house to tell us that he had called together his family, to make sure of the precise color of his brother's eyes, and that the generality of reminiscences was in favor of the color described by Adele. This particularity gave me great pleasure, inasmuch as this gentleman having said to Adele, *' You are wrong ; my mother thinks his eyes were blue ; do you persist in seeing them of a hazel color ?" Adele replied, " It would be very easy for me to say as your mother, since she believes them such, and that would add to the truth of all I told you ; but I should be telling a falsehood and not saying what I saw : to me they are as I have described them." It was in consequence of this declaration that the gentleman convoked a family meeting, and thought himself bound to inform me of the result. M. B confided to me that he had often had a visit from his brother in his dreams; that some time ago he dreamed, that after his brother was dead and laid out, he beheld the lid of the coffin raised, his brother rise up on his feet, extend his arms, tearing the shroud, and say to him in a calm, steady voice : " Why do you weep for me ? Don't you see that I am not dead ; on the contrary, I am born to life — this is the entrance to it [pointing to his coffin] — we shall meet again ; be calm and hope."

>Third Sitting. — M. Blouet gave an account of this fresh sitting to his friend, who came himself to the house a few days after, and assured us that, from the information he had obtained as to this woman, Adele had given a correct description of her as well as of the place where she used to go to bed, and the three cellars which still exist. I put this gentleman in correspondence with Adele, who told him the spot where she thought the treasure would be found. The gentleman acknowledged that the particulars relative to the cellars were exact, and as to the treasure researches only could prove how far she was correct.

>Accordingly, I now proceed with the evidence. In 1820, numerous experiments were performed by me in Paris, at the Hotel-Dieu, and many incredulous physicians, attracted by the novelty, witnessed them, and wished to satisfy themselves that there was no deception. To this I assented, and accordingly they proceeded to prove the insensibility of the patients by a variety of tests, many of which were very cruel ; but these experiments were not performed by me ; it was a sort of sacrifice of humanity which incredulity insisted upon, and in the infancy of the science I had no alternative excepting to permit them, or allow truth itself to be compromised by the refusal. Hence the unconscious patients were subjected to the following trials : — their lips and nostrils were tickled with feathers ; their skin was pinched until ecchymoses (bruises) were produced ; smoke was introduced into the nasal passages, and the feet of one female were plunged into a strong infusion of mustard-seed at a high temperature. But not the slightest sign of pain did they evince. The expression of the countenance remained unchanged, nor was the pulse in any degree affected. On being awakened, however, out of the magnetic sleep, they all experienced the pain usually attendant on such applications, and were exceedingly angry at the treatment they had received. Many of the physicians who had witnessed this scene, and who were convinced of the reality of the magnetic influence, applied to me to teach them how to conduct the operation, and several very soon acquired the method, upon which they proceeded to convince themselves, by their own personal experiments, of the absolute extinction of sensibility in such cases. The means they adopted were on many occasions revolting, but the result removed every shade of doubt from their minds. I now, therefore, proceed to adduce their evidence. It is no longer I who attest the facts ; and praise or blame, should either be bestowed, will be alike inapplicable to me. Here, therefore, I subjoin the following proces-verbal by Dr. Kobouam, who was then attached to the Hotel-Dieu. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 6th of January, 1821, M. Recamier, on visiting the hospital, requested me to put into magnetic sleep a man named Starin, whose bed was No. 8 of the ward Sainte-Madelaine. M. Recamier first threatened him with the application of moxa,* if he allowed himself to fall asleep, and I caused the patient, much against his will, to pass into the magnetic sleep, during which M. Recamier applied the moxa on the fore-part of the right thigh, which moxa produced an eschar seventeen lines in length and eleven in breadth ; that Starin did not manifest the least sign of pain, either by crying out, gesture, or variation of the pulse ; that he did not feel the application of the moxa until I had roused him out of the magnetic sleep. Madame SainteMonique, the matron of the ward, MM. Gibert, La Peyre, Bergeret, Carquet, Truche, &c, &c, were present during this seance" Here, also, is another procesverbal by the same physician. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 8th of January, 1821, at the request of M. Recamier, I put into magnetic sleep the woman Leroy (Lise), lying in the bed No. 22 in the ward Sainte-Agnes. M. Recamier had previously threatened that he would apply a moxa to her person if she allowed herself to fall asleep. I, Robouam, then, much against her will, caused the patient to fall into magnetic sleep, during which M. Gibert burned agaric under her nostrils, and this nauseous smell produced no perceptible effect ; that afterwards M. Recamier himself applied moxa on the epigastric region (pit of the stomach), which produced an eschar of fifteen lines in length and nine in breadth ; that during the operation, the patient did not shew the least symptoms of suffering, either by cries, gestures, or variation of the pulse ; that she remained in a state of perfect insensibility, and that on awakening from the magnetic sleep, she shewed signs of suffering great pain. MM. Gibert, Crequi, &c, were present at this seance? (Signed,) Robouam, Docteur-Medecin.

>The magnetic influence, when thus communicated, instead of inducing sleep, generally gives rise to spasms, convulsions, and alarming symptoms. On another occasion, I was magnetising a lady who was but little sensible of the magnetic influence^ when a person who stood beside her felt, during the operation, her limbs benumbed, and pricking pains in her eyelids. On the following day the same lady was again magnetised, without the intention of producing an effect on any one else ; but the same attendant again experienced symptoms more decided than on the preceding day, and remained the whole of that day afterwards in a state of excessive lassitude. Again, at the next seance she was affected so much that somnambulism was brought on, and yet I had no intention of producing this result. She soon awoke ; but, yielding to sleep again, she remained in this state for several hours. A similar incident occurred to me while operating at the house of a patient of mine, the wife of a counsellor of state. Her lady's-maid, who attended the sitting to render assistance if necessary, was seized, while I was magnetising her mistress, with severe spasms, which soon became very alarming. I rose to subdue them, but she hurried away, declaring that I gave her pain, and that she would not allow me to come near her. She, however, soon recovered, and I attributed the effects only to an excited imagination. When perfectly recomposed, she sat down again near to her mistress, upon whom I recommenced the magnetic operation as before. But in about five minutes, and without any intention on my part to exert any influence on this attendant, she was again seized with the same description of paroxysm, accompanied with considerable pain and difficulty of breathing, from which she did not recover for several days afterwards.

>There is yet another circumstance that merits further attention. The earliest manifestations in France, as in the United States, were not written or oral, but were transmitted through rapping or knocking that indicated the letters of the alphabet, forming words and sentences. This is how the communicating intelligences declared themselves to be spirits. Although we admit the involvement of the medium’s mind in the production of verbal or written communications, we cannot attribute the same involvement on the part of the medium in producing rapping or knocks. The medium could not have known them beforehand.

>Theo. We do not. But as this question of the duality — the individuality of the Divine Ego, and the personality of the human animal — involves that of the possibility of the real immortal Ego appearing in Seance rooms as a "materialised spirit," which we deny as already explained, our opponents have started the nonsensical charge.
## 18: Blavatsky (1889) 391 [1]

>Enq. You seem very bitter against Spirits. As you have given me your views and your reasons for disbelieving in the materialization of, and direct communication in seances, with the disembodied spirits — or the "spirits of the dead" — would you mind enlightening me as to one more fact? Why are some Theosophists never tired of saying how dangerous is intercourse with spirits, and mediumship? Have they any particular reason for this?
## 19: Blavatsky (1889) 394 [1]

>Theo. It is because I believe in them with too good reason, and (save some cases of deliberate fraud) know them to be as true as that you and I live, that all my being revolts against them. Once more I speak only of physical, not mental or even psychic phenomena. Like attracts like. There are several high-minded, pure, good men and women, known to me personally, who have passed years of their lives under the direct guidance and even protection of high "Spirits," whether disembodied or planetary. But these Intelligences are not of the type of the John Kings and the Ernests who figure in seance rooms. These Intelligences guide and control mortals only in rare and exceptional cases to which they are attracted and magnetically drawn by the Karmic past of the individual. It is not enough to sit "for development" in order to attract them. That only opens the door to a swarm of "spooks," good, bad and indifferent, to which the medium becomes a slave for life. It is against such promiscuous mediumship and intercourse with goblins that I raise my voice, not against spiritual mysticism. The latter is ennobling and holy; the former is of just the same nature as the phenomena of two centuries ago, for which so many witches and wizards have been made to suffer. Read Glanvil and other authors on the subject of witchcraft, and you will find recorded there the parallels of most, if not all, of the physical phenomena of nineteenth century "Spiritualism."

>1st Sitting. — Binet (Bruno), my first ecstatic, was a young man, twenty-seven years of age, of mild disposition, and very limited intelligence in point of spiritualism, having read and heard but little of magnetism. He submitted to my action with confidence, and presented me with somewhat rare phenomena ; he was not isolated, recollected all he said in his crises, was sent to sleep by a single look from me, underwent the laws of magnetic attraction with a great sensibility, was completely dependent on my influence, and recovered his independence instantaneously ; he beheld perfectly the interior of bodies, and gave salutary counsels, possessed a retrospective view of events and actions dating from a few years to half a century, and described them remarkably well ; he beheld not objects near him, but distinguished them perfectly well at a distance, and gave me great proofs of singular lucidity. I kept a journal devoted to his material views, from which I have extracted whatsoever related to metaphysics and the spiritual world. It was about a week ago that I was magnetizing him, when I beheld him thrown off his seat as if by a thunderbolt, his countenance inflamed, and himself under the influence of a fear, which he sought to disguise from me under the sem.blance of a cou7-age he no longer possessed. *' What is the matter with you?" said I to him. " I have just heard a voice on my right, that told me your complaint was incurable, and that I am no longer to trouble myself about it ; I thought no one was near me, and then I was struck with a commotion that I can not account for." — " Ask who it was spoke to you ?" " It was my guide," is the reply. — "What is the guide's name V " Gabriel." — Bruno answered me in a low voice as the voice spoke to him. He was at least a week in habituating himself to this voice, which was hereafter to be the oracle to answer the questions I put to him with respect to the spiritual world.

>8. At this sitting I obtained no information worth mentioning. Bruno is aroused, and if, perchance, I put to hira a question previously submitted to him (a circumstance fraught with great difficulties to me, unable as I am to recollect exactly whether I have put such or such a question), he is suddenly aroused, saying, " You have already been answered." This has occurred several times, even in medical consultations. I am consequently, obliged to take every possible precaution.

>11. " Ask your guide whether it was God. whom you, in your ecstasy, saw the other day ?" " No, it was Gabriel himself." — *' Why did he appear to you thus presiding at his council ?" " He was not presiding at a council that day, he wished to give me a sitting." — " For what purpose ?" *' To display to me the glories and riches that God has in store for those who love him." — " What do you mean by glories and riches V* " I mean the faculties with which the soul obtains what constitutes its joy." — " Is he always attired thus ?" *'No ; it was to impart more charms to my vision." — " Ask him if Gabriel is his real name?" " No; the angels in heaven have no name; they may take one to visit men : that of Gabriel signifies God's angel of light."

>I must not terminate this sitting without making mention of a somewhat similar revelation of which I was once a witness at a party to which I had been invited to see a somnambulist who was singularly susceptible of the physical influence of her magnetizer. A gentleman approaches her to consult her as to an indisposition he experienced, and, I believe, to know at the same time what to think of somnambulism. Scarcely was she in communication with him than she said to him : " Your complaint is not in the least dangerous ; it is an inflammation caused by an unfortunate passion you have." — " What passion V* asked he. " You will not take offence if I mention it before company." — " Mention it ; I have naught to reproach myself with." " You are too often thirsty." — Every one began to laugh, following the example of the consulter. " I have not always had this failing," replied he. " I perceive it, and I also perceive the cause," — " What is it ?" " A long, long time ago, you passionately loved a young person ; she did not return your love, because you were not disposed to wed her, for good reasons which you then had. You left that part of the country in which she lives, and since that time she conceived such a hatred toward you that she wished you all possible harm; you became a victim to her evil influence." — " What do you mean by that V " I mean that from that period you have been under the influence of an evil spirit, that has disordered your conduct, by kindling in you a fire which you always thought you could extinguish or moderate, by giving yourself up to drink ; and, what is more, those desires for drink are in you periodical." — " What you tell me is exact as to the circumstance and my failing ; but I can not believe that such is the real cause." *' You clearly perceive, however, that I tell you the truth on one point, I do not deceive you on the other; but don't be down-hearted, there is a remedy." — " Drinking no more, doubtless '?" " Oh ! you could not leave it off of yourself; there is no power but that 1 shall point out to you that can set you free." — " Tell me what that power is ?" ** At night, before going to bed, kneel down, pray to God from the bottom of your heart to deliver you from this failing ; then, rise, animate your thoughts by the recollection of what I tell you, strive to pass into a state of exaltation, then raise your arms, fancying to yourself that this person is present before you, and cast at her, with disdain and wrath, the evil fluid with which you are impregnated, saying, ' Evil spirit who besettest me, flee far from me, in the name of God, the sole Creator, thy master and mine; return to the source whence thou earnest.' Pray your good angel to aid you in this operation ; do this until you are released, and you will not be long before being so, I assure you." — " How would you have the fluid of which you speak rejoin that woman who is more than a hundred and fifty leagues from here ?" " Fancying to yourself that she is in your room, she will no longer be a hundred and fifty leagues off." — " I can't comprehend that." " Act withou*t comprehending, and you will see." The magnetizer, who believes not in spirits, but takes much delight in rendering his somnambulist cataleptic, resumed his experiments without paying any attention to what he had just heard. As this revelation bore so close an affinity to those of Bl^uno and my other ecstatics, I took note of it, and now mention it, deeming this to be an appropriate place, in order to fix the thoughts of the reader on this kind of possession. True that this is raising new difficulties as to the existence or nonexistence of free-will, and apparently in favor of the latter belief. However, this kind of alienation of the faculties of men could not be generalized, and this power of a few beings over their fellows would rather seem merely an assemblage of two organizations, one of which is destined to subdue or dominate the other for a time and similar enough to the power of magnetism, which is null before an organization that enters not into correspondence with it ; unfortunate, indeed, would it be were it otherwise ; the mere wish of an enemy would suffice to reduce you to a state the most abject and dependent; I repeat, however, that it is possible.

>20. After a moment's concentration, Bruno perceives coming toward him an angel, in celestial costume — transparent robe, wavy hair, feminine physiognomy, legs bare, feet in buskined sandals ; this angel carries oif Bruno, who tells me he is leaving his body and going away ; at the lapse of an instant, he says : " I have traversed clouds ; my angel conducted me to my father, and left me alone with him." — " "What was your father doing?" "He is still reading." — "Is he happy]" ♦* Yes." — '* Does he eat, drink, and sleep ?" " He eats, drinks, and sleeps, only when disposed to do so for pleasure's sake, and not through necessity ; if he has a mind for a pear or any other fruit, he gathers it and eats it ; but I repeat, it is not through necessity, for spirits have no wants of this kind in heaven." — " What are their usages and occupations ?" " The same as on eai-th, what best pleases them." — " What are their acquirements V " Such as they are pleased to have, they study and learn by themselves what they desire to know." — " Can your father be deceived?" "No." — "Can he answer me a few questions V " Yes." — " Was it a good spirit that came at the last sitting ?" " No, I suspected him ; but they are all so very malicious, and wrap themselves up in so much precaution that one has some difficulty in recognising them." — " What now tells you that it is really your father who speaks to you 1 Can an evil spirit assume his form ?" " Yes : but my father will make himself known by placing his hand on his breast, a sign that an evil spirit can not take, because God permits only the good to make use of these kinds of signs : — an angel, for instance, will be recognised by a star, a crescent, a diamond, or precious stone. Were it not for this we should never distinguish between a good and an evil spirit."

>The third revelation in this sitting is, that in heaven there are only sorts of images. I am unable, as yet, to decide respecting this, without fuller information. Already, on earth, the spirit has the assurance to fancy that it creates what it pleases, a creation unappreciated by our senses, but apparently quite real to the spirit in a state of somnambulism. No one exists who may not have assured himself of the pretended reality of this creation. This creating power, which belongs only to God, which man draws from the world, his type, can attain such a degree of force that matter finds itself dependent and paralyzed by it. All the harmony of its laws finds itself anniliilated by the facts of attraction and suspension. It should not be denied that an ecstatic can stand materially on a stool created spiritually. These facts, without saying that in heaven the objects which surround us are the offsprings of our imagination, tend, nevertheless, to prove it; when, on the contrary, being then of the nature of the world of causes, we can dispose of them to our advantage, floating in that atmosphere of images, they group around us, according to the divine thought which presides over them, in order to satisfy our wants by which they find themselves denominated or called.
## 26: Cahagnet (1855) 35 [1]

>25. "At the last sitting, you told me that your guide could speak to you at five hundred leagues distance ; this revelation for a moment astonished me ; but, in presence of daily experiments, by the distant communications that take place, I have yielded to this truth, that there is no distance appreciable to spirits. I return to other revelations you have made me ; you told me that in heaven are cities, places, according to the desire of the spirit of each ; you told me, also, that one beheld only the object desired, and this would induce me to think that this must be an effect of the creation of the spirit, and not places existing eternally." " They are places that exist eternally ; but the facility which one has of communicating with them, and the same facility of no longer seeing them, would make us think that they have no real existence like terrestrial objects. I will give you an example : 1 am beside you, in any part of heaven ; I desire to be on a plain, in a garden, or house, I myself find and see what I desire, without stirring from the spot, if such be my wish ; you also form a desire, but you wish to be in a church, a ballroom, or any oilier place, you are there instantaneously, without however, quitting me for a moment; in like manner, instead of a library, another will desire to see a picture, these two objects exist together, visible to the two desires, and at the same place. Thus you see it is a mystery altogether mcoraprehensible, which men will deny, although a grand i!rulh." — " The description you give me would make me doubt whether there be anything real in heaven." "All that is there is more real than on earth, where everything perishes or changes its form. As to heaven, all these objects are imperishable, and constitute your eternal joy : only, not being subject to the same laws as matter, there is no need of pulling down a house to build another in its place ; it disappears, and another replaces it. Although disappeared, it nevertheless exists, because it can not be destroyed ; but as I repeat to you, it presents no obstacle to the admission of another in its stead." — " Then, in heaven, every one, according to his inclination, may, no doubt, build cities, temples, palaces." " No ; the desires which spirits have are communicated to them by God, who is the sole and grand architect. Man fancies himself the artificer of all- these things, when he merely forms the wish for them ; but the cities there are uniform, the palaces a hundred times finer than all that human conception could bring forth or believe ; and all this is appropriated to the tastes and wants of the societies inhabiting them. There is so much harmony between your spiritual tastes that you could not desire what another spirit would not wish, especially — mark it well — if this spirit were a member of your society, who would be, as it were, a fibre of your body ; for spirits can not influence each other, and where they foresee what reigns not in accordance with their desires, they associate not. They assemble to exercise usages which are but pleasures, and not wants. In like manner, they isolate themselves, if they think fit." — " If I wish to compose a book and have it read, what means can I employ to gratify this desire ]" " You compose your book, you desire to possess five hundred copies of it; you desire to give them away, advertise, or sell them ; all this is performed as on earth, with this difference, "however, that happiness is the result, and not trouble, as on earth. You possess this work for ever, if such be your wish. The spiritual life may be explained in a few words : you desire only what it is agreeable to you to possess, and the goodness of God gratifies you instantaneously." — " But if I desired the wealth of my neighbor V " We can desire in heaven only what we are able to obtain ; we do not enter heaven with thoughts of robbery, disturbance, falsehood : all such thoughts are of the domain of the earth, and can not accompany us on high." — " You have told me also that a spirit could appear in several places at once ; how is that V " They are only images of the spirit that appear ; he may have as many as he pleases, and send them to you." — '• Good ; but do these images speak ?" "Yes." — "They are, then, so many individuals." "No; it is ever the same one." — "All these images, you say, appearing in different places at once, and answering different questions, would make us suppose them masses of spirits, instead of one." *' It is difficult enough to explain to you this mystery ; but T will endeavor to do so for your instruction. The spirit who directs me, and who is in heaven, can draw from himself, by a sort of radiation, a multitude of threads, extending and serving as a means of communication with those who desire to correspond with him. The spirit can impart to each thread the resemblance and sound of his speech, although, among themselves, spirits speak but little, thought being the only bond of communication. Then he can at the same instant convey his thought, which answers the questions of those in communication with him by means of these sympathetic threads ; he is but one, multiplying himself according to circumstances, ad infinitum, and is seen by all at once, as the entire audience at a theatre sees an actor. We fancy him in a hundred places at once, when, on the contrary, it is a hundred spirits that are enabled to see him, and in the place where he is ; but his image can, in like manner, fulfil this office, and this would make one believe in the existence of a hundred individuals. This image proceeding from him is in correspondence with his thoughts, and can, like him, represent them, for thoughts are unalterable. I am fatigued."
## 27: Cahagnet (1855) 36 [1]

>This sitting was the last that Bruno gave me. His summing up has a reference to the observations I made at the close of the twenty-third silting, to the effect that the image may remain impressed on a place where the object has sojourned, and this proves materially that spirits may possess the power of undoubling themselves better than material objects do. These phenomena can not be explained, nor can they be denied. As I wish to keep within the limits I proposed to myself, to borrow nothing from the books I have read, and which would no more be believed than ray word, I cite none of those proofs which, however, are very curious and instructive. Suffice it for me to recommend the reader to experimentalize by himself on all those facts and the following ones, which are not less curious. We can see well only by our own eyes, comprehend only by our own judgment. I shall see hereafter whether I can throw any light on these revelations.

>26. Mademoiselle Fanny Binet, sister of Bruno, a young girl of seventeen years of age, the very model of candor and virtue, said to me one day : " I had a very extraordinary dream last night; you were magnetizing me and I fell asleep like my brother ; I saw on the table a sphere, such as professors have to teach astronomy; a prodigious quantity of circles surrounded it ; I saw issuing from this globe a sort of smoke, which you projected into the pit of my stomach." I induced her to be magnetized, as her dream augured well ; she consented to it, and in about twenty minutes fell into an ecstatic sleep. At this sitting and the following ones I sought to turn to account this state, and recognise her speciality ; it was ecstac}^ and here is the result : " I perceive sometliing coming toward me." — *' What is this something V " It is a person, I believe." — " Look well ; have you asked for any one ?" " No." — " It is a person of your acquaintance." "No." — "Is it a man?" "Yes." — " What sort of a man 1" " His deportment is noble and very imposing.; he is wrapped in a beautiful mantle of red velvet, edged with gold ; he is sitting on a throne, I believe, covered with blue; he has on his head a large and very beautiful crown of gold ; he is holding a little child in his arms ; he seems to wish to get rid of it; this child is quite naked." — " Do you see this man's face 1" " No, not very distinctly." — " Beg him to draw nearer to you, and tell you who he is." "I don't see him better ; he does not approach." — " Then repeat from the bottom of your heart these words, * In the name of God, thy creator and mine, stranger, whom I behold, if thou comest not from him, and art not a spirit of light, withdraw; I have no need of thy services." " He is gone ; but a new face now presents itself much nearer." — " Repeat the same invocation, and you will see how this spirit will act." " It stays ; it is a woman. Oh ! what a beautiful countenance, never did I see such a one." — " In what position, with respect to you, is she V *' Before me, a little to the right."—" Does she appear to you alive V " She does, indeed ; she is borne on clouds, and quite surrounded with such an azure as I never before saw, so lively, fresh, and transparent is it." — " How is she attired V " In a beautiful robe of red velvet, descending to her feet, bordered with bands of gold ; her hair is black, and falls down upon her shoulders, which are of an incomparable whiteness ; on her head is a crown of gold, but much narrower than that of the first figure ; she has on a robe of light gauze. But, good heavens, how beautiful she is," timidly said the young girl, her head drooping on her bosom. — " Ask her if she is your angel or guide — request lier to speak to you and tell you her name." " Oh ! she smiles on me ; but I am so overcome with respect and admiration for it, that I don't seem worthy of her answering me." — "Venture, however, she is a celestial creature, who, no doubt, desires only your good, and comes in order to be of service to you : she will answer you." Fanny is so absorbed in admiration that I am obliged to wake her, without obtaining any results but this vision. Scarcely is she awake than she sees herself in the glass, and hides her face in her hands, exclaiming, " Oh, how ugly I am compared to the beautiful creature I saw." — "Eh ! what? you recollect then what you have seen 1" " I recollect but too well, as it furnishes me with a comparison which is all to my disadvantage." — "You are wrong, I never saw you looking more beautiful than at this moment." It is tiue that this young person has a prepossessing countenance ; she had at this moment that angelic expression that all ecstatics have in the height of ecstacy, and it was impressed on all her features. She could not be induced to look upon herself in such a light, and remained the whole day under the influence of this vision, recounting it in all its details to the persons around her.

>33. " Madame," said I to her, "hitherto we have not occupied ourselves with serious things in your sleep; you have received a good education, which has developed in you very skeptical thoughts ; you are strong-minded, you would not allow yourself to be imposed upon by mere reveries ; will you endeavor to enter into communication with the inhabitants of the other world ?" " I do not believe in their existence ; but if you can let me see them, I shall be most happy." — " In that case, desire with all your heart to see your angel, I will request him to appear to you." " Here he is." — " Already?" " Yes." — •' Give me a description of him ?" " His countenance seems to me noble and gracious, though rather stern." — " Angels, it is said, are not ordinarily stern ; no doubt it is an evil spirit, who, as usual, presents himself first ; if he is not an angel of light, pray God that he may disappear." "He is gone." — " Come, madame, no error on the part of your imagination ; you are in a condition to enter into communication with the inhabitants of the other world ; be pleased to regard with circumspection that you may be the better convinced of the results we shall obtain." " I saw perfectly well this person, whose sombre and stern physiognomy struck me so forcibly that I have no wish to recommence the trial. I should prefer seeing another, particularly my father, who has been dead a very long time, in order to assure myself whether or not he still lives ; let us leave the angels." — *' Since you prefer seeing your father, call him." "Oh! here is another, a little angfel — oh! oh!" Madame F. then goes off into a state difficult to describe ; she weeps, calls on me to rouse her, falls back with her head against the wall, her bosom swollen by sobs ; she seems to suffocate under the weight of her grief, and it is only at the expiration of a few minutes that I can obtain an answer to this question." — " What, then, do you see ?" " My son ! my poor little Ernest; wake me !" — '* Wake you because you see your son: what is there so dreadful in seeing^ one's son? How do you see him, alive or dead 1" "Alive; although he has been dead these fourteen years." — " A reason the more to rejoice at seeing your child again; what age was he at. his death?" "Six months." — "How old does he seem to you now?" " About three years old." — " Since he would now be fourteen, why does he appear to you only three years of age ? one would think that he would rather appear to you not more than six months old." " God wills it thus ; children that die before they are three years old, seem not to exceed that age." — " How is he dressed ?" " He is quite naked ; he has little wings." — " Are you quite sure he is your son ? Repeat the same invocation as that you addressed to the wicked angel," " Oh ! it is really my son ; he stays, assuredly ; I can recognise him; how fair he is!" And she continued weeping. — " Would you like to see him when you are wide awake, to satisfy your curiosity and overcome your incredulity ?" " Oh ! yes." She becomes somewhat calm. I ask her if she can still see her son. " Yes ; he is calling to some one who seems to be unwilling to advance." — " Do you wish to see another person 1" **Yes,- a friend whom I lost a very long time ago; but I can not see licrr — " You ought not to have asked for this friend before obtaining the result of your first wish, which was to see your father; you ought to have waited for him." " It is he whom my son is calling; he has no wish to come." — *' That is, as I repeat to you, because you have a greater desire to see another person in preference to him." She awaits a few minutes longer, but her father does not appear. She requests me to wake her. When I believe her to be thoroughly aroused, I put to her several questions which prove to me, as before, that she has no recollection of what she has seen or said. She fixes her eyes on one point on her right, and cries out, " Wake me, then." I disengage her as quickly as possible, her eyes still remaining fixed in the same direction. I ask her what she perceives there. " I don't know ; it is a dark point that draws my attention thither, and I am unable to turn my eyes away." — " Look at me." She does so, and exclaims, " What does all this mean, monsieur ?" " I know less than you, madame, but you will explain it to me presently." I place my hand on the region of her heart, and she then cries out that she perceives her son amid the clouds that attracted her attention ; and says to me, " It is my first child, whom I thought little of, having at his death bestowed all my affections on his brothers and sister. It is very astonishing that this child, who was then but six months old and would now be fourteen years of age, should appear in your room : I should like to know what this means!" "It means what you sought to know, madame, that the dead exist as well as we do ; you desired, in your sleep, to see your father, no doubt he preferred sending you this child, whom you say you n» longer thought of, in order that you may not think that in desiring to see your father, and havinsf seen him, that is a mere effect of the imagination or hallucination. You expressed a wish to see this child when you were awaked in order to remove all your doubts in this respect; you ought to be satisfied." — "Did you really see him 1" " Yes, monsieur." — " Did you really recognise him ?" *' Yes, but you, did you not see him?" ** No, madame, I was not in your state." — " How surprising all this is ! it is enough to derange the strongest mind. Assuredly I saw him ; I dare not think of it, 'tis miraculous; a child that I had not thought of for so many years !" " He still thinks of you, madame ; those in heaven are not so forgetful as we are." The effect experienced by this lady was not the same as in her sleep, she looked upon her son without emotion, matter had resumed its sway. She quitted me inveighing against magic and natural philosophy ; I did not become attached to this somnambulist, as it required much labor to obtain from her satisfactory results. This sitting is not devoid of interest, and proves again that the desire is not always the sole mover of spiritual visions. This lady desires to see her father, and she sees a little creature that she was far from thinking of at the moment; a scene ensues. The father seems unwilling to obey the request of the mother and son, the latter appears with little wings; like the child of Francoise he is about three years old ; like the other, he is naked ! Hence, conformity of apparition. It is to be attributed to this, that appearing in a more advanced age, they would be less easily recognised, or do they remain in this state of innocence ] We shall see hereafter in a revelation of the same kind. This lady, I think, was not gified with an inventive imagination, since she thought she should see nothing, and what she did see she sought not, without being able to obtain what she desired. This is a very singular apparition, and sets all doubt aside.

>34. I HAD been devoting for some time my attention to a young person afflicted with a disease of the chest ; — one day, Madame Reviere, her aunt, who was always present at my sittings, requested me to try and send her to sleep : I succeeded in doing so. After being acted upon magnetically for about twenty minutes, she was in a state of somnambulism, and begged of me not to question her, but leave her in the happy state she then was. Scarcely had a few minutes elapsed before I could perceive that she was in an ecstatic state, from which I roused her when I thought necessary, knowing that it is often dangerous to prolong it ; she bitterly reproached me on rny want of patience, saying, that she had never experienced like happiness. " Where were you and what have you seen ?" asked I. *' I was in a magnificent open country, illumed by a superb day-light, the vegetation was admirably rich ! I felt that I had abandoned my body, and I proceeded toward a spot where I beheld beautiful sheep grazing, and judge of my surprise, when I perceived my good father watching them. When I begged of you to leave me alone for a moment, I had been wishing to see my father, having heard you say that in this state, one can see and speak with the dead. I had reason to be astonished at perceiving him watching a flock. It is no dream ; and had you not interrupted me, I should have spoken to him," — " We will recommence the experiment when you please, madame. Did your father ever tend flocks 1" " Oh ! no ; I am certain that I was not dreaming, I saw perfectly well, and experienced a happiness unknown to me. Were I at liberty to open my eyes I should believe that they are not closed, so conscious am I of being in my normal condition ; I beg you will open them for tub, for it is singular enough, that I can't do it myself."

>Adele Magnot, whom I have known for a long time, is a somnambulist by birth. In her childhood she was sorely afflicted with somnambulic fits, compelling her to get up at night to terminate or continue her day's labors. I advised her to be magnetized, in order to cure, or, at least, divert the course of her fits of somnambulism ; she consented to it, and since then her sleep is undisturbed. From the first sitting she was a somnambulist, and her first speciality is for maladies. She possesses, in this respect, a clairvoyance equivalent to that she has for spiritual views, and for which, from her charitable disposition, she had more taste. No interested views have ever guided her ; she gives and receives not, I kept a journal devoted to all she could tell me or do in her slumbers, and will now collect from it whatsoever bears upon spiritualism. I again claim the indulgence of the reader for a work which is above my knowledge and strength ; let none behold in me, as I have said at the commencement, any other pride but that of opening or strengthening, in all who read me, a belief that constitutes all my happiness. It is a debt which I owe to humanity, and would wish to discharge as I best can.

>40. Louise, true to the promise she had made i^dele at the last sitting, announces to her her second brother. " What brother is this V ^' It is Jean Marie, who also died in Africa, three years ago." — Adele contemplates with delight these three members of her family ; the latter is also in the uniform of a dragoon ; she talks, as in the preceding sittings, a long time with them, acquaints me not with the subject of their conversation. " What do your brothers do in heaven ?" *' They amuse themselves, promenade." — "We can neither amuse ourselves nor promenade a whole eternity without an object." " Oh ! they play music, study tlie sciences ; they occupy themselves better, and with more pleasure, than we do."

>42. " You were not very reasonable in your last sleep, it was a suicide you would have committed, and you know that is very wrong !" " True, but once committed, one must needs enter like the rest." — " What is the punishment that God reserves for suicide V " That which he inflicts on all those who do evil, a public reprimand; after that, God renders it impossible for them to do evil, by consigning them to a place apart." — " What sort of place is it ? Is it the hell of which men speak ?" " There is no such hell as is depicted on earth; there are places of purification, which are termed places of punishment, because one is there deprived of the sight of God and his divine light ; but those who are there are happy." — " And all great criminals, where are they ?" *' In similar places, assembled in society ; but, as God is so good, he provides for all, prevents evil, and re-establishes good in the hearts of all." — " We are, then, in societies in heaven." " We seek one another, and assemble toerether according: to our tastes." — *' Is there any disturbance sometimes in these societies ?" " No, because the thoughts of every one are laid bare ; consequently, none can be deceived. The criminal, the passionate man, the virtuous and good man, can not, the one any more than the other, appear what they are not, or disguise their thoughts as on earth ; it is a sort of stamp engraved within us, and not to be effaced." — " In that case we ought to recollect all we have done on earth." " No ; for the simple reason that we set no value on it, all that is forgotten ; we no longer occupy ourselves with such things ; we merely study the thoughts, the affections present and necessary to the common happiness ; we pity those who are still on earth, pray to God for them, and are delighted when they rejoin us ; for them it is a time of trial, which each must undergo in liis turn." — " Do we meet again among friends 1" " Yes ; but, if the affections are different, we separate, each to enjoy apart what is agreeable to him." — " We receive there instruction as on earth, I suppose, as every one is not learned on entering heaven, the child as well as the old man." " Instruction is not the same there as on earth, because, on our arrival, our spirit comprehends forthwith whatever it desires to know ; we speak there but one language, which is that of thought ; all, from the infant to the old man, can speak and comprehend it from their very entrance ; in like manner, all can read. It is only for the superior sciences, the knowledge of the laws of the spiritual world and the mysteries of God, that there are teachers, who are more like friends than masters, and we learn in a short time what we desire to know." — " Who tells you these things ?" " My mother, who gives me to understand that I want to learn a great deal in one day." — *' Ask your mother whether we see God in heaven." '' Yes." — " In what form ?" *' That of a sun, so dazzling that we can not fix our eye on it ; no one can form an idea of its brilliancy." The answers at this sitting are so much the more astonishing, as Adele, in her state of vigil, is unacquainted with my way of thinking on spiritual things, and which is not exactly in accordance with what she tells me in her sleep ; I can not, therefore, influence her in this respect; she has not the speciality for the communication of thoughts, and this should remove the idea, which might be conceived, of her reading in mine. I have sufficiently studied her to this effect in circumstances wherein she had a powerful interest to do so, but never was I able to succeed in making her comprehend a single thought. I have equally maintained the greatest reserve, by never recounting what my somnambulists tell me in their sleep. How does she happen to accord so well with Bruno and others who preceded him, and especially in all the reiterated questions that I shall address, by-and-by, to various deceased personages'? — questions far beyond the ordinary intelligence of Adele.

>43. *' Here is my mother" (same emotion as usual). She announces to me the arrival of her father. "Here he is!" Adele opens her arms, as she did at the first visit of her mother; her agitation and joy are no less great ; she clasps her hands, and humbly bends her head t(j receive her father's blessing ; then talks of family affairs ; her brothers are present. What surprises me most is, that she could see all her relations only at intervals of time — more or less long; had it been merely the fruit of imagfination in her, she could have seen them at the same sitting, or the following one, at least; but their arrival was announced by her niece, or her brothers, at fixed, periods.

>46. "You told me at the last sitting that spirits could pass without difficulty through all bodies ; this would induce the belief that their substance is but a compound of air ; can these spirits assume any other form besides the human one ?" " Yes, whatever form they desire, especially evil spirits, who take delicrht in all sorts of diss^uises." — " This would make me believe in the malicious spirits who cause those apparitions so industriously circulated in the country." " It is a reality ; they take delight only in troubles of this kind." — " Do you believe that these spirits have the strength to upset articles of furniture and a thousand other things, as it is said ] I can not accord such power to air, a light fluid can not disturb a heavy one." " You do n't believe it ! it is, however, this light fluid, as you term it, that imparts motion to your body, and can also, by transporting it from one place to another, charge it with a heavy burden, without your knowing that it is the spirit alone that possesses the strength to move this matter, though shackled as it is by its bonds. Why should you refuse it a double or triple force when it is freed from it ? Know that the spirit can bear the heaviest burdens, light fluid as you believe it to be, and can effect things of which you have no conception." — " I accorded it this power within us because we furnish it with 'organs and fluids wherewith to operate, but I do not think that out of matter it has any power over it." " It is as I have just told you ; you can not conceive that it has the same organs, that it is it which is the life, the strength, the action, the mover of matter; and what has moved it a minute can also move it an eternity." — " Can these spirits, as it is affirmed, repair to your orders to obey you?" "They desire nothing better; they obey you a few instants in order to draw you into their society, and become, at a later period, their slaves." — " What do you mean by that? — they have a leader, then?" "No, they are all free and independent; but you become their slaves, as the gam.bler is the slave of the places he frequents, of the passions, the consequences, of which he undergoes; they aided you to do evil, after your death you aid them to do what you took a dehght in seeing them do for you." — " Many persons doubt what you now say, because they have sought to enter into communication with them and have not succeeded." " That may be accounted for thus : in the first place, their good angel diverted them from such a course ; secondly, if you ask for a spirit out of the mass, as you would for a soldier out of an army, none will answer only to his name ; we should know, therefore, to whom we address ourselves ; do so in proper form, and not make the request while dreading its execution. A truce to such conversation ; I don't like it." — " Can you tell me the name of my angel ?" " Gabriel." — " And the name of yours ?" " Raphael." — " There are, then, many angels named Grabriel ?" " There is no dearth of them — it is a society." — " Can an angel convey messages and objects, as some religious persons and magnetizers have said V* " Yes, but that happens very seldom ; it can be effected only by quite a special protection of God. My mother tells me that I wish to know a great deal." ** Tell her that it is in order to instruct yourself, and avoid being laughed at by your brothers for your ignorance." — "Could your mother be deceived!" "No." — "And your niece V " She might, because she is yery young and thoughtless; no doubt she has been forbidden to speak to me, as she is much more quiet now."

>47. For several sittings Adele's mother did not come, but at this one she appears, and complains to her daughter of my incredulity in her presence, telling her that I had carried my doubts so far the last time as to try and lay hold of her with my hand ; that if ever I recommend such an experiment she would come no more to visit her ; that I ought to have as much confidence in her as she had in me ; and that, moreover, I could never feel or touch a spirit. Adele is very much astonished at this communication. I wish to assure her of the contrary, but she believes her mother in preference to me. It is quite true that I mechanically put out my arm toward the spot where I supposed Adele's mother to be, without for a moment considering that I could not feel a spiritual body ; but this silly experiment on my part has presented me with a solution which I was far from expecting, as it assures me that no other being but Adele's mother could have been acquainted with my then present thoughts. Adele, as I have observed, not having this speciality, and had she possessed it she would have given me to understand forthwith that I was doing a silly act; neither has she the speciality of seeing bocbes or objects present, she sees only the interior of sick persons : she could not be aware of this incident, and, had she divined it, she is incapable of dissembling so far with me. We shall see, by-and-by, that she is worthy of all confidence ; a single fact of this nature proved may admit a hundred. This sitting was to be pregnant with good results : Adele's mother predicting that one of her daughters, Adele's sister, would get married in a short time, that she would not be the first to acquaint her with this change in her position, but that her brother, who was in the country, would brinor \iqi^ the news. She also tells her the name of the person to whom her sister was to be married, though he was then unknown to both the latter and Adele. Her father informs her, at the same time, that she will shortly hear that another of her sisters had been brought to bed of a girl. The prediction was realized, point for point, two years after, and the communication was perfectly true. Here, then, are three facts emanating from real communications, and not from any other combination.

>57. I forwarded to the abbe an account in writing of all that I had obtained at this sitting ; then, this gentleman, unable to call to mind any such name, proceeded forthwith to the library of the archbishopric, where a register was kept of the priests who died in the diocese of Paris. Next day he came to my house with a copy of the registers for the last three years, but we could neither find such a name nor any one of that age. We were convinced that Adele had been under the influence of hallucination, a circumstance which had never occurred since she had been a clairvoyante. I was all the more vexed at this as her brother, who had never before deceived her in any of his revelations and predictions, was the author of this trick, which came somewhat late, but in time to tell me not to cease entertaining distrust of spirits.

>63. Before introducing other personages, I ought to give an account of another apparition of M, Lauriot, the results of which are as follows : " I told you at the last sitting that we could not accept your advice. You have not been asked for, why did you come ?" Adele says that she takes a delight in seeing this man, whose goodness she can appreciate to its full extent, and that he may come to her at all times without the risk of her driving him away, — " Then ask him why he told you that his mother was not dead, since she died before him V* *' He answers that he did not say so ; that I wrongly interpreted his words, as he knew very well that she was dead, and could not have said the contrary." — " And the Latin which he answered you at random V '* I can not understand material words, and yoa did not transmit to me those that were addressed to me ; yoa said to me, ' They speak Latin to you.' I thought it was on the subject of the works; hence it was that I replied to you affirmatively." — " Why did you not reproduce the abbe's words to M. Lauriot?" "Because it was a wearisome task; as I was conscious that I had to do with a man who believes in nothing, I preferred committing an error to continuing this kind of communication." — I observed to Adele that she did wrong ; that she ought rather to have said, that such a mode of speaking was not agreeable to her, and that I perceived that M. Lauriot could easily have answered the observations of the abbe (who, after hearing him, thought like me, that M. Lauriot was still insane). Thus terminated the apparitions of this personage. 64. " Here is the gentleman that my brother said he would send to me." — " What is his name 1" "He answers, that we do not and should not know him."—" Has he lived on earth V* *' Yes : but he is a foreig:ner." — " Where was he born ?" " In Spain." — " Where did he die V " In Spain." — " In what city ?" "He has no information to give on this point; we should not know him." — "Give me a description of him." " He is tall, stout, and maybe about seventy-five ; his hair is still very black, although there are a few white hairs in his beard; he is very fresh, and has the appearance of having been a rich and very respectable man." — I put several questions to this gentleman, all which he answered very correctly ; but it would be superfluous to mention them here. Having no wish to make this work a treatise on alchemy, I reserve the information given me for a separate work. I made the abbe acquainted with this new apparition in all its details, and he appeared satisfied. We devoted a few sittings to conversation with this man, whom we found obliging and sensible ; but the abbe, who was very changeable, incredulous, and inconstant, proposed to me a decisive experiment, which I accepted as much for my own instruction as to afford him pleasure ; for man can not too highly cherish within him a belief in the spiritual world, by making experiments called for by the least of his doubts. We were agreed on this point, both the abbe and myself. I had doubted, and at times still doubted, for a pure spiritualist is not to be instantaneously made out of an extra-materialist, and the abbe had one doubt more than I ; as he feared on my part charlatanism. He had a right to do so, as he knew me not, and I, for my part, was glad to meet with such a man whose doubts were to turn to my advantage.

>66. I had sent an account of this sitting to the abbe, but I neither saw him nor heard from him. I thought that Adele had made some mistake. Three days after he arrived with his servant-girl, who brought me a portrait of M. Mallet, which he had been to borrow of one of his friends. Only judge of my surprise, equal to his, when I beheld feature for feature the man so well depicted by Adele, and especially the mark, which was no less ihan the scar of a sabre wound, which this gentleman had received in the army. The abbe said to me : '* I may now acquaint you with the history of the count de Mallet. He was one of the grand dignitaries of the empire, having held a very high rank in the army. At the death of his wife he embraced the church party with not less zeal than he had served the empire. He was superior of the nuns of Sainte Marie de Lorette, and died in the parish of Saint Sulpice, the 28th August, at the age of sixty, regretted by the upright and good ; he devoted much time to metaphysics, and wrote a work on this science, which I will lend you ; it is the fruit of elevated and not superstitious reasonings."

>The abbe is quite delighted at this experiment ; he can no longer doubt the truth of these apparitions, convinced as he is, that I did not know this gentleman, seeing that I had no particulars furnished me respecting him, that he had expressly avoided being present at this sitting, in order not to establish any communication of thoughts. What astonished him most was this mark — this gash — and he himself did not know whether it was under the right eye or the left ; to make sure of it he had been to borrow the portrait which he showed me, in order that I might judge of the correct likeness of the apparition; he looked upon this fact as conclusive, and declared, himself convinced. He wished me to send Adele to sleep, in order to put a few questions to her. I forthwith complied with his request. Adele was struck at the likeness of the portrait which she had seen before going to sleep, to that of M. Mallet. The latter answered the questions of the abbe with an exactitude that enraptured the piiest, who also put to him the following one : *' M , the person who lent me your portrait, and was one of your friends on earth, has begged of me to ask you whether you had anything to say to him]" — "Yes; let him take good care of his health, he is poorly." <' The abbe thought that this answer accorded but little with what he had just seen of this person, who was not in the least indisposed ; then he left me. The abbe returned the next day to tell me that be had imparted to his friend the advice of M. Mallet, and, to his great astonishment, found that he had really been unwell for a fortnifbt, that he had been obliged to neglect his business, and that his maid-servant was saying to him only three days jjo-o — If M. Mallet were still alive, assuredly he would recommend you to take better care of yourself This particularity conferred more value on the revelation than we had at first thought.

>72, The 8th of July, 1846, I magnetize Adele in order to put her in com.munication with the soul of a youncr woman who died on the 2d of the same montb at the age of twentyfour. Her presence was scarcely requested when she appeared with an infant in her arms, which she had lost almost at its birlh ; the apparition of this child astonished us, inasmuch as we little expected it. Adele is not much disposed to ask her any questions, saying to me : " Leave me an instant with her, and give her time at least to recollect herself in her new state." Adele experiences a painful emotion at the apparition of this woman, whose name was Eliza, and weeps bitterly. These tears were sufficient evidence of her good faith ; Eliza appears to her clad in white, with a crown on her head ; she says that she is very happy, and can not understand why she was afraid to die. She wished she had quitted the earth sooner. iShe says to Adele : ** When you followed me to the grave, you entertained the thought of placing a souvenir on my tomb : it would afford me much pleasure if you would do so." I ask Adele whether she had had a like thought? " Yes, I bargained for a small medallion but did not purchase it." I beg Adele to swear to me by the ashes of her mother, that what she just told me is exact, and that it was really Eliza who divined her thought. Adele fervently protests to me that she has told the truth, and that in such a circumstance it would be a sacrilegious falsehood to deceive me. " I do not think you have deceived me ; but, possibly, you asked her if she would wish for this medallion which you had a mind to buy for her V " No, it was she who told me of it, I no lonq-er thoug^ht of it." — " Does Eliza attach any value to her body, that she desires to see it adorned with a medallion 1" "No; but the dead always like to 2^crceive kind tokens of remembrance in the hearts of those they have left behind." Eliza's husband was present at this sitting, and could not believe in such apparitions ; he said to me : " Adele watched over the last moments of Eliza ; she was struck at such a death ; the attachment she bore my wife may possibly react on her imagination ; could you furnish me with another proof of the truth of those apparitions?" "Yes, on one condition, which is, that you consider well of the person whose apparition you request ; you will so manage that we shall have never seen nor heard of this person ; take all your precautions ; I will only ask you for the name. After this proof, ask no more, endeavor to make it conformable to your wishes. Ah ! I will prepare this for you, and to-morrow we'll see." — "Very well."

>I had a very good one." — " Since your death, have you increased your stock of knowledge, which, on earth, was already very considerable 1" " No, on the contrary, I have lost more than I have gained of that description which is no longer my affection ; when on earth, I wished to instruct men in what it was useful for them to know ; but now this desire no longer pursues me, and all the knowledge necessary to material life ceased being explained to me when I went to heaven." — *' What is your predominant affection now?" "lam in the society of a few friends ; we occupy ourselves with celestial philosophy ; in the state I am, we know whatever we desire to know, and this is a continual souice of felicity." — " Have you any knowledge of the primitive creation of man ?" " Yes; but I do not think fit to explain it to you." — " Could you explain to me his properties and relations with the universe ; men believe now in a system, and you seem to approve of such a one in your works, which demonstrates man as representing in miniature the entire universe ?" " Man is really a representative of what may be confined to his globe, seeing that he possesses within him all the essences composing it ; but there ends his resemblance with the universe." — " Some have gone so far to say that he had in him, independently of all that exists materially, places, actions, universal thoughts, inasmuch as he finds himself in the places he desires to see ; knows the actions and thous^hts which exist and no lono;-er exist. How explain such a power V " The material man is a compound of all that exists materially ; that is to say, he has in him the essences of each of the kingdoms, but not places and distances. The spiritual man has alone the faculty of knowing places, actions, and thoughts, which are rightly without the material body and not in it ; as the terrestrial essences, he may clear these distances, which for him exist not ; he may know past actions, since for him there is nothing annihilated, but the present, the past, and the future are only a condition of being presented to him by matter. He may communicate with all these things, which are so many unities without, and form but one with him, according to the power of his desire." — " Were you acquainted with magnetism before your death ; you seem to indicate as much in your works ]" " I was not acquainted with its properties in all their development, I had but a confused knowledge of them." — " You equally appear to indicate in them phrenology, by saying that thoughts are agglomerated in the head in kinds of societies, separately incased 1" " Our head is but a compound of confused thoughts, which, when not directed and incased by the spiritual man with discernment, lead to the love of evil." — "Could you give me a clear description as to the nature of thoughts ?" " God, in creating man, 'provided us all with an equal number of thoughts ; there exists not a single being who possesses one more than another. It is for man to separate the good from the bad, if he wishes to be honest and eschew evil." — " How should he manage, since he appears not free to act according to his wishes ?" •* He could do so by dismissing the first thought that leads him toward evil. If, on the contrary, he does not repel it, by asking of God the strength necessary to do so, this thought engenders others, which, in a short time, form a mass of thoughts leading man toward evil or good." — " The thoughts, then, according to you, engender like living beings 1" " They assemble and encrender of each other. I will endeavor to give you a material example : G-et a couple of ants (seeing that everything is by pairs in the creation), separate them, instead of bringing them together, by putting them each in a small hole ; they will be quite at their ease, and will not propagate ; if, on the contrary, you bring them together both in the same hole, in a short time the society they have engendered, unable any longer to contain itself in this hole, will burst forth, seeking elsewhere a more suitable space. In like manner with the thoughts ; master the first one by preventing it from uniting with another, and you will have no trouble to fear." — " I approve of your comparison ; but since God is the author, the creator of all things, he has deemed fit, then, to create good and evil thoughts % Were it not for this assemblage of good and evil, half the human species distributed as kings, judges, priests, soldiers, intrusted with the keeping of the other half, would be useless]" "I have told you that every man possessed the same quantity of thoughts, which he was at liberty to class and govern according to his idea. If the Deity has deemed fit to create such or such thoughts, he owes us no account of it, since he does not render us responsible for the direction we have given them by not punishing us for them." — " These thoughts, which, from your comparisons are naught less than living beings, coupling and engendering, under what form are they seen in heaven and on earth ?" " On earth they represent, en tableau, the action they concur in causing to be executed, and in heaven they are represented as characters written in gold." — Adele is surprised at not having seen, when she went to heaven to see her relations, such a representation of thoughts. M. S wedenborg tells her that she was unable to see them, inasmuch as she was still in a state wherein a diaphanous body is imperceptible. *' I saw," replies she, " in the body of my relations as in crystal !" He answers: "You saw what might be compared to crystal ; but, were you to see a diaphanous body in all its brightness, you would find it infinitely superior." — "Yvhere does that writing in gold appear to be placed 1" " In the heart and the head." — " Are the bad thoughts also represented in the same way ?" " Yes, but the bad ones can not enter heaven." 80. " Do you still think, as you seem to affirm in your books, that heaven has the form of a man ?" *' Heaven has not the form of a man. I made use of this figurative comparison only the better to make ray readers comprehend the affinities of the affections of the soul with the organs of the body of which I represented heaven as a type." — " You told me at the last sitting that it was seen en tableaux how earthly thoughts are accomplished ; but our clairvoyantes go so far as to tell us or predict to us words which will not be pronounced till a period very remote. How can speech be represented ?" " Clairvoyantes have two ways of becoming acquainted with thoughts : 1st, by sensation; 2d, by view in pictures. Future speech as present is not more difficult to be represented in pictures than actions ; speech is the picture or description of an action and every action may be represented in a picture. I will take for example, slander: you say of a person that he is a thief, an idle fellow, or so forth ; the person who shall pronounce these words is seen pointing out him whom he slanders, and the latter doing the action of which the former speaks ; and the clairvoyante, judging from the apparent degree of candor the person slandered may tell whether it is a truth or a falsehood. Sensation is more difficult to be defined ; there must be an intimate relation with the person and the events." — " Are the thoughts liable to external influences V " Yes, by the good and the evil spirits." — " We see every day actions committed which appear to be the result of an Instantaneous thought: are they to b.e attributed to the influence of spirits ?" " No, not always ; the influence of spirits consists in the eniiancing or abasing f>f a thought, or they contrive to prevent the efl'ect of it, for some purpose or other; but there is limited their power. The spiritual man is ever free to appreciate it at its exact value, there is naught instantaneous in his actions ; all that appears externally is the fruit of interior combinations, sometimes unknown to the material body, hence they are fancied to be instantaneous." — " What makes me disbelieve in free-will are the predictions of clairvoyantes who, very often announce to us things that we have no reason to suppose will happen. How can that be? Make me understand it." " As I have already told you, the thoughts agglomerate around a mother-thought, a type which it is easy to recognise. The clairvoyante sees this progression of ideas and can judge with assurance in what time they will overflow, in order then to hurry on, by the trouble they convey into the harmony of ihe material body, the latter to execute the action they are preparing. The prettiest equally as the strongest thoughts have all one and the same source and object." — " Your solution is a very good one for animated matter ; but we have also predictions as to whole nations and individual beings still unborn, how can that which does not yet exist be seen ]" " There exists not an action but what has ever existed, either in germ or vibration ; for the clairvoyante time exists not. I repeat to you, if his attention is directed to dates, epochs, he sees in the world of causes that which will happen at such a period ; he is also and most frequently apprized of these predictions by the divine power which desires that they should be known beforehand, that men may prepare themselves to receive or execute them."—" I am too much obliged to you for your revelations to have the least wish to raise objections to what you say to me ; but if God permits these things to be known of men, it is in some sort saying to them, you can not hinder them, and all this proves not free-will. I will make but one objection more : if we have not the intelligence of directing aright our thoughts, and have beside us a guide who can influence us to this effect, why does be not employ his power at this moment in order to be of service to us ?" " He ever employs it ; but his power is submitted to yours, which repels it, because it sympathizes not with it, with that affection especially which predominates in you for the execution of your project." — "You conclude that man is free]" "All men, on cording into the world, having respectively the same number of thoughts, may dispose of them at will ; far from free would he indeed be who had not all that is necessary for liberty; but if you are in a library containing all sorts of works, you consult the one which is to your taste ; you can not in anght reproach the library which contains all that it is possible for you to desire. What makes you believe that man is not free is, that the exterior has no knowledge of the affections of the soul, which prepares the execution of them."

>There is nothing incredible in what I have just said, since all religions, in general — sects, societies, governments even — place themselves under the aegis of those spiritual societies and the chiefs who have founded their material societies; so strictly true and rational is the view which appears irrational to man — termed superstitious. In order to develop the proofs of what I advance it would be necessary to write a treatise on purpose; such is not the object of this work, which permits us not to enlarge on every secret, as so doing would only disturb the ensemhle, already too often interrupted, of our revelations. We will pass on to sittings 79 and 80. The notions supplied by our good Swedenborg on the assemblage of thoughts, their aggregation, must agree with the phrenological system, with the adepts of that of corpuscules, and confirm, above all, that exclamation of the learned English chemist, Davis, after an ecstasy occasioned by the laughing gas: "The whole human organism is but an assemblage of thought !" We see by the notions given us how they are perceived in heaven and on earth; we remain convinced, no matter how they are so, that they are indestructible and survive the actions they have brought forth; we obtain this proof through the revelations made to us by clairvoyantes on the past. This single fact alone suffices to establish the existence of the soul after its separation from the body, and, above all, the unity of its self ; for, to speak logically, of what use would be the survivorship of these thoughts, these actions, after the annihilation of the being who had been their author? Why should it be impossible for the soul to continue its existence, since all that concurs in surrounding it in its material life exists for eternity? We see every day our clairvoyantes depicting to us as present events, individual actions that took place years ago, and the knowledge of which could not have reached them in any other state. Were this still the effect of the communication of thoug-hts, it would not the less prove that the memory is perpetually enriched by whatever man has seen, done, known, or thought, that nothing is lost or effaced on these tablets of the book of life ! What I have just said is the plainest side of the medal; but the other is much more positive. For it is possible for a clairvoyante (since it is seen every day) to enter into communication with beings that have disappeared centuries ago from our globe, and find again in their memory the most trivial of their earthly actions, which are as unknown to the clairvoyante as to the magnetizer ; here, there is no longer any communication of thoughts ! They can equally foresee the action which will be executed in a century or two, and the individual who will perform it, &c. In actions which seem most deeply buried in oblivion, we perceive that to the clairvoyante they are as full of life as if they had but just been executed ; and we would have the soul alone not to profit by this immortal life, its individuality, its self^ after its separation from the body, though all that we have just cited is immortal, individualized! For shame ! apparitions become useless before such phenomena wishing to think otherwise is no longer to think.

>88. Emile Rey, ten years of age, of a waggish and very curious disposition, was a little neighbor of mine, and frequently came to spend an evening at my house, when I used to make him recite a few pieces in verse. When I had made the magic glass I have already spoken of, the composition of which was given me by M. Swedenborg, I had a mind to try the first experiment on Emile, though I did not think his turbulent nature well adapted to these kinds of visions, for which a little submission is required. He perceived nothing in it, but, as I have just said, he was very inattentive. One of his little comrades of a more quiet disposition, perceived in it different things which he desired to see, and this gave me the assurance that my mirror was a good one. I had a mind to try again on Emile, by the experiment of the water-bottle, which Cagliostro often employed to convince his auditors of his magic power : he beheld very distinctly divers remote places ; perceiving, from this, that he had propensities for the magnetic sleep, I magnetized him, and in a few minutes he slept; his curious disposition led him to travelling ; he acquired, in a very short time, this speciality, and left me no doubt as to the worth of his clairvoyance. It was this child of whom I spoke farther back, whose sleep was called in question by M. Demarest, because, in a distant view at that gentleman's house, he took a surtout for a paletot, and, in a closed box, a small twosous piece for a liard. I tried to put this child in communication with spirits disengaged from matter ; I told him to ask to see his an^el. " Here he is." — " How is he dressed ?" " He is quite naked." — I repeated a prayer for the dismissal of this spirit if he were not sent by God ; Emile said, " I no longer see anything, he is gone." I summon the good one. " Here he is ; 'tis no longer the same." — "Why so?" '* This one is dressed ; he has a blue robe, a pink girdle, beautiful white wings, fine flaxen hair ; he is much handsomer than the other!" I desire the latter to be gone, as the former ; he remains, and tells Emile that he is sent by God. " By what sign may you be recognised, in case the evil one should think proper to take your place V He points out to Emile a small white spot on his forehead. "Have you lived on earth 1" "Yes." — "When did you die?" "I don't knovi^." — "What do you do in heaven V " I play there ; we have plenty of amusement." — "With whom do you play f "With children of my own age ; I ride on horseback." — I ask Emile how old this angel appears to be. He replies : " About my age." — " Are you fond, too, of riding V " Very ; my angel is on a fine dapple-gray horse." — "What! at this moment?" "Yes." — " What is there in heaven V* " A fine garden, fine fruits, fine flowers." — " Can we eat these fruits and pluck these flowers?" — " No, God forbiJs it." " Does your angel see the earth ?" " No, he can see only heaven." — " Does he see the men of the earth 1" " No, he can see but me." — " Can he see me also 1" " He could do so, since you are en rapport with me." — "Would your angel be so good as to show himself to you when you have been waked up?" "Yes." — I terminate this sitting. Emile, on awaking, perceives his angel when I lay my hand on his heart, as he had recommended me to do ; he gives me the same details as to his dress as when sleeping.

>Madame Gouget, forty-eight years of age, having heard speak of magnetism, had herself magnetized by several persons, the last of whom, according to what she told me in her sleep, had completely upset her. I knew this woman to be a very good kind of person, and was grieved one day, when she came to pay me a visit, to hear her give utterance to a mass of incoherences, as proved to me that she was under a very baneful influence, and that her mind, which already suffered from it, would sooner or later sink under it. She had left off" beinsf magnetized ; but she felt the want, in order to recover her normal condition, of finding a magnetizer who could rid her of the evil influence of the last one ; she begged me to render her this service. Not feeling myself equal to such a task, I gave her the address of the baron Dupotet, to whom she went. He magnetized her, examined her by the power of his art internally, and perceived that she was deranged. He did not refuse her his services (he is known to be too good for that), but this poor woman durst not return to him. She was advised to go to her first magnetizer, but this was needless, inasmuch as the man was unacquainted with magnetism. Grieved at seeing this woman combating the influence of her baneful magnetizer, who employed all the energy of his will to bring her back to him, in order to profit by her at his pleasure, I undertook to snatch her from this secret obsession. I succeeded in doino- so at the close of five sittings, and restored the unfortunate creature to a state of thinking and acting as before her disorganization. I have just given a few details which are necessary to persons engaged in magnetism, and which show how scrupulous we ought to be in the choice of a good magnetizer.

>To resume : Adele, who has this speciality only through revelation, in a consultation asked for, in her turn, by Madame Gouget, took her revenge, telling the latter many hidden particularities of her life, which the good woman had some difficulty in calling to mind. Never had I obtained a more curious sitting ; self-love was mixed up with it, without turning to jealousy, and I acquired the certainty, and, as I have said, intentionally, that if the last thoughts and actions are reserved with such care in the domain of the memory, and survive the annihilation of the body, wherefore should the soul which has elaborated these thoughts be alone destroyed, or not have the recollection of its self, its individuality, since all that constituted this individuality is by no means dispersed in the domain of the universe ! but, on the contrary, seems to form in it a bundle more compact, and much better to be appreciated, than in the material life.

>III. The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over‐Soul, the latter being itself an aspect of the Unknown Root; and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul—a spark of the former—through the Cycle of Incarnation, or Necessity, in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic Law, during the whole term. In other words, no purely spiritual Buddhi (Divine Soul) can have an independent conscious existence before the spark which issued from the pure Essence of the Universal Sixth Principle—or the OVER-SOUL—has (a) passed through every elemental form of the phenomenal world of that Manvantara, and (b) acquired individuality, first by natural impulse, and then by self‐induced and self‐devised efforts, checked by its Karma, thus ascending through all the degrees of intelligence, from the lowest to the highest Manas, from mineral and plant, up to the holiest Archangel (Dhyâni‐Buddha). The pivotal doctrine of the Esoteric Philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts in man, save those won by his own Ego through personal effort and merit throughout a long series of metempsychoses and reïncarnations. This is why the Hindûs say that the Universe is Brahman and Brahmâ, for Brahman is in every atom of the universe, the six Principles in Nature being all the outcome—the variously differentiated aspects—of the Seventh and One, the only Reality in the Universe whether cosmic or micro‐cosmic; and also why the permutations, psychic, spiritual and physical, on the plane of manifestation and form, of the Sixth (Brahmâ the vehicle of Brahman) are viewed by metaphysical antiphrasis as illusive and mâyâvic. For although the root of every atom individually and of every form collectively, is that Seventh Principle or the One Reality, still, in its manifested phenomenal and temporary appearance, it is no better than an evanescent illusion of our senses.
## 2: Blavatsky (1888) 678 [1]

>Man is not, nor could he ever be, the complete product of the “Lord God”; but he is the child of the Elohim, so arbitrarily changed into the singular number and masculine gender. The first Dhyânis, commissioned to “create” man in their image, could only throw off their Shadows, as a delicate model for the Nature Spirits of matter to work upon. Man is, beyond any doubt, formed physically out of the dust of the Earth, but his creators and fashioners were many. Nor can it be said that the “Lord God breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life,” unless that God is identified with the “One Life,” omnipresent though invisible, and unless the same operation is attributed to “God” on behalf of every “Living Soul,” which is the Vital Soul (Nephesh), and not the Divine Spirit (Ruach) which ensures to man alone a divine degree of immortality, that no animal, as such, could ever attain in this cycle of incarnation. It is owing to the inadequate distinctions made by the Jews, and now by our Western metaphysicians, who are unable to understand, and hence to accept, more than a triune man—Spirit, Soul, Body—that the “Breath of Life” has been confused with the immortal “Spirit.” This applies also directly to the Protestant theologians, who in translating a certain verse in the Fourth Gospel have entirely perverted its meaning. This mistranslation runs, “the wind bloweth where it listeth,” instead of “the spirit goeth where it willeth,” as in the original, and also in the translation of the Greek Eastern Church.
## 3: Blavatsky (1888) 1967 [1]

>As our Planet revolves once every year around the Sun, and at the same time turns once in every twenty‐four hours upon its own axis, thus traversing minor circles within a larger one, so is the work of the smaller cyclic periods accomplished and recommenced within the Great Saros. The revolution of the physical world, according to the ancient doctrine, is attended by a like revolution in the world of intellect—the spiritual evolution of the world proceeding in cycles, like the physical one. Thus we see in history a regular alternation of ebb and flow in the tide of human progress. The great kingdoms and empires of the world, after reaching the culmination of their greatness, descend again, in accordance with the same law by which they ascended; till, having reached the lowest point, humanity reässerts itself and mounts up once more, the height of its attainment being, by this law of ascending progression by cycles, somewhat higher than the point from which it had before descended.
## 4: Blavatsky (1888) 2106 [1]

>51 “Pilgrim” is the appellation given to our Monad (the Two in one) during its cycle of incarnations. It is the only immortal and eternal Principle in us, being an indivisible part of the integral whole—the Universal Spirit, from which it emanates, and into which it is absorbed at the end of the cycle. When it is said to emanate from the One Spirit, an awkward and incorrect expression has to be used for lack of appropriate words in English. The Vedântins call it Sûtrâtmâ (Thread‐Soul), but their explanation differs somewhat from that of the Occultists; to explain which difference, however, is left to the Vedântins themselves.
## 5: Blavatsky (1889) 61 [1]

>Theo. Before I can answer you, we must argue upon what you mean by "I" or "Ego." We distinguish between the simple fact of self-consciousness, the simple feeling that "I am I," and the complex thought that "I am Mr. Smith" or "Mrs. Brown." Believing as we do in a series of births for the same Ego, or re-incarnation, this distinction is the fundamental pivot of the whole idea. You see "Mr. Smith" really means a long series of daily experiences strung together by the thread of memory, and forming what Mr. Smith calls "himself." But none of these "experiences" are really the "I" or the Ego, nor do they give "Mr. Smith" the feeling that he is himself, for he forgets the greater part of his daily experiences, and they produce the feeling of Egoity in him only while they last. We Theosophists, therefore, distinguish between this bundle of "experiences," which we call the false (because so finite and evanescent) personality, and that element in man to which the feeling of "I am I" is due. It is this "I am I" which we call the true individuality; and we say that this "Ego" or individuality plays, like an actor, many parts on the stage of life. (Vide infra, "On Individuality and Personality.") Let us call every new life on earth of the same Ego a night on the stage of a theatre. One night the actor, or "Ego," appears as "Macbeth," the next as "Shylock," the third as "Romeo," the fourth as "Hamlet" or "King Lear," and so on, until he has run through the whole cycle of incarnations. The Ego begins his life-pilgrimage as a sprite, an "Ariel," or a "Puck"; he plays the part of a super, is a soldier, a servant, one of the chorus; rises then to "speaking parts," plays leading roles, interspersed with insignificant parts, till he finally retires from the stage as "Prospero," the magician.
## 6: Blavatsky (1889) 320 [1]

>Theo. You cannot, because you will mix up an abstract representation of the whole with its casual changes of form. Remember that if it can be said of Buddhi-Manas that it is unconditionally immortal, the same cannot be said of the lower Manas, still less of Taijasi, which is merely an attribute. Neither of these, neither Manas nor Taijasi, can exist apart from Buddhi, the divine soul, because the first (Manas) is, in its lower aspect, a qualificative attribute of the terrestrial personality, and the second (Taijasi) is identical with the first, because it is the same Manas only with the light of Buddhi reflected on it. In its turn, Buddhi would remain only an impersonal spirit without this element which it borrows from the human soul, which conditions and makes of it, in this illusive Universe, as it were something separate from the universal soul for the whole period of the cycle of incarnation. Say rather that Buddhi-Manas can neither die nor lose its compound self-consciousness in Eternity, nor the recollection of its previous incarnations in which the two — i.e., the spiritual and the human soul — had been closely linked together. But it is not so in the case of a materialist, whose human soul not only receives nothing from the divine soul, but even refuses to recognise its existence. You can hardly apply this axiom to the attributes and qualifications of the human soul, for it would be like saying that because your divine soul is immortal, therefore the bloom on your cheek must also be immortal; whereas this bloom, like Taijasi, is simply a transitory phenomenon.
## 7: Blavatsky (1889) 375 [1]

>Theo. It is this nature, mysterious, Protean, beyond any grasp, and almost shadowy in its correlations with the other principles, that is most difficult to realise, and still more so to explain. Manas is a "principle," and yet it is an "Entity" and individuality or Ego. He is a "God," and yet he is doomed to an endless cycle of incarnations, for each of which he is made responsible, and for each of which he has to suffer. All this seems as contradictory as it is puzzling; nevertheless, there are hundreds of people, even in Europe, who realise all this perfectly, for they comprehend the Ego not only in its integrity but in its many aspects. Finally, if I would make myself comprehensible, I must begin by the beginning and give you the genealogy of this Ego in a few lines.
## 8: Blavatsky (1889) 409 [1]

>Theo. No, they cannot be so strictly defined in their effects as to show that each individual environment, and the particular conditions of life in which each person finds himself, are nothing more than the retributive Karma which the individual generated in a previous life. We must not lose sight of the fact that every atom is subject to the general law governing the whole body to which it belongs, and here we come upon the wider track of the Karmic law. Do you not perceive that the aggregate of individual Karma becomes that of the nation to which those individuals belong, and further, that the sum total of National Karma is that of the World? The evils that you speak of are not peculiar to the individual or even to the Nation, they are more or less universal; and it is upon this broad line of Human interdependence that the law of Karma finds its legitimate and equable issue.
## 9: Blavatsky (1889) 411 [1]

>Enq. And are there no means by which the distributive or national Karma might be concentred or collected, so to speak, and brought to its natural and legitimate fulfilment without all this protracted suffering?
## 10: Blavatsky (1889) 412 [1]

>Theo. As a general rule, and within certain limits which define the age to which we belong, the law of Karma cannot be hastened or retarded in its fulfilment. But of this I am certain, the point of possibility in either of these directions has never yet been touched. Listen to the following recital of one phase of national suffering, and then ask yourself whether, admitting the working power of individual, relative, and distributive Karma, these evils are not capable of extensive modification and general relief. What I am about to read to you is from the pen of a National Saviour, one who, having overcome Self, and being free to choose, has elected to serve Humanity, in bearing at least as much as a woman's shoulders can possibly bear of National Karma. This is what she says: —
## 11: Blavatsky (1889) 415 [1]

>Theo. What right have we to think so while one-half of humanity is in a position to effect an immediate relief of the privations which are suffered by their fellows? When every individual has contributed to the general good what he can of money, of labour, and of ennobling thought, then, and only then, will the balance of National Karma be struck, and until then we have no right nor any reasons for saying that there is more life on the earth than Nature can support. It is reserved for the heroic souls, the Saviours of our Race and Nation, to find out the cause of this unequal pressure of retributive Karma, and by a supreme effort to re-adjust the balance of power, and save the people from a moral ingulfment a thousand times more disastrous and more permanently evil than the like physical catastrophe, in which you seem to see the only possible outlet for this accumulated misery.
## 12: Blavatsky (1889) 503 [1]

>Theo. The Theosophical ideas of charity mean personal exertion for others; personal mercy and kindness; personal interest in the welfare of those who suffer; personal sympathy, forethought and assistance in their troubles or needs. We Theosophists do not believe in giving money (N. B., if we had it) through other people's hands or organizations. We believe in giving to the money a thousandfold greater power and effectiveness by our personal contact and sympathy with those who need it. We believe in relieving the starvation of the soul, as much if not more than the emptiness of the stomach; for gratitude does more good to the man who feels it, than to him for whom it is felt. Where's the gratitude which your "millions of pounds" should have called forth, or the good feelings provoked by them? Is it shown in the hatred of the East-End poor for the rich? in the growth of the party of anarchy and disorder? or by those thousands of unfortunate working girls, victims to the "sweating" system, driven daily to eke out a living by going on the streets? Do your helpless old men and women thank you for the workhouses; or your poor for the poisonously unhealthy dwellings in which they are allowed to breed new generations of diseased, scrofulous and rickety children, only to put money into the pockets of the insatiable Shylocks who own houses? Therefore it is that every sovereign of all those "millions," contributed by good and would-be charitable people, falls like a burning curse instead of a blessing on the poor whom it should relieve. We call this generating national Karma, and terrible will be its results on the day of reckoning.
## 13: Blavatsky (1889) 546 [1]

>Theo. They are worse for his moral and spiritual growth than meat, for alcohol in all its forms has a direct, marked, and very deleterious influence on man's psychic condition. Wine and spirit drinking is only less destructive to the development of the inner powers, than the habitual use of hashish, opium, and similar drugs.
## 14: Blavatsky (1889) 652 [1]

>Theo. Scarcely. But I must tell you that during the last quarter of every hundred years an attempt is made by those "Masters," of whom I have spoken, to help on the spiritual progress of Humanity in a marked and definite way. Towards the close of each century you will invariably find that an outpouring or upheaval of spirituality — or call it mysticism if you prefer — has taken place. Some one or more persons have appeared in the world as their agents, and a greater or less amount of occult knowledge and teaching has been given out. If you care to do so, you can trace these movements back, century by century, as far as our detailed historical records extend.

>Note. — The buttons that Adele was unable to define were in metal, of a dirty-white ground, and surrounded by a blue circle. In this apparition is a phenomenon extraordinary enough : that is to say, Adele experienced the same kind of illness as this man. I was obliged to disengage her by passes ; she suffered horribly. What answer can we make to such facts ? unless it be that the past, present, and future, are only conditions of being with matter — only a succession of different states, which in a particular state are ever represented in the present — and this would confirm (for this state only) the belief in a creation without beginning or end ; that is to say, an actual, momentaneous one. Stay not to observe what precedes and what follows creation ; the state which it represents to you is for you whatsoever is. I shall be asked whether this man himself suffered at this moment as Adele appeared to suffer. I will answer, no. He is in the world of causes, wherein hnrmony reigns. Had Adele been totally disencraged from her material body, the latter would not have suffered ; it is only the sight of the state of the material body of this man at the time he suffered, that awakens in Adele sympathetic effects in the material molecules, and produces this suffering, the impression of which remained on the spiritual body of this man. We have already said that it was possible for a clairvoyante to perceive a deceased being at any age of his life, as well as in any dress he may have worn at different periods of his life. It must be the same with all external wounds and internal diseases : nothing is effaced; they are so many impressions left, to recall, no doubt, to the individual possessing them, what he has suffered or done at such an age, and to facilitate in him the comparison of his actual state with his prior one, and this must ever be to him a source of happiness; his present position is ever preferable, and that to which he aspires, as an eternal progression, must surpass all the rest. Thus, how many pevS(<ns on earth are there who feel sick at the sight of a sore or the letting of blood ; how many sympathetic eff*ects are there that are communicated in all nervous effects, such as gaping, laughter, crying, epilepsy, convulsions ; how many persons that are unable to follow the respiration or diction of another person without stifling, &;c., &c. I once noticed in Adele a fact of this nature, which I find it impossible to account for. She was consulted by an asthmatical person ; she was seized with sympathetic fits of asthma, and in a few seconds expectorated great quantities of thick mucus of a yellowish-green, with the same effort and as often as the patient. Her pocket-handkerchief was full of these thick humors in a few minutes ! Adele never spits ; and, habitually, she perceives rather than feels the ailments of sick persons, although she has the two properties at once. I leave medicine to explain this phenomenon, as I shall leave many others to psychology and physics.

>It is proper, therefore, to deeply and seriously investigate the original structure and motive power of man, together with the man), complicated parts which are uniformly made evident external: and by understanding the forms and forces, and the consequent perfection which is manifested in the human organism, you will perceive a correspondence to all else, whether superior or subordinate, existing in universal Nature and her laws. Know one and you consequently know the other; and by investigating and exploring all below the power of mind, constituting your own nature, you arrive analogically at the relative powers of the original laws of motion, which have governed from the beginning, and do still manifest an undeviating tendency to universal and eternal progression.
## 17: Davis (1847) 216 [1]

>δ 26. Therefore the Whole is composed of parts, and the parts compose the Whole; and all these combinations in Nature are producing designedly that principle which is so vague and indefinite to the mind —　which is the subject of much contemplation, but not a substance which can be proved to exist by external investigation; though it is known to exist as an eternal ultimate, of which proof —　mathematical demonstration — exists in Nature. And it is only necessary to comprehend general and universal laws, as these point to that spiritual and intellectual principle, which cannot be known to exist by any other process of investigation, external or internal. But it is demonstrated by these known laws, which are constantly producing and developing corresponding principles, ascending in their degrees of perfection. For these laws exhibit an infinite chain of progression: and as the whole forms one great circle, it comprehends and combines all other circles or corresponding motions and developments that exist in subordinate spheres. And so the original Cause uses Nature as an instrument —a means —a vessel fitted in all its various parts and complications, to produce its ultimate, which is Spirit.
## 18: Davis (1847) 258 [1]

>The principles of Nature (as now manifest), and the laws and forces of mechanics, are a progression of the inherent properties and essences primitively contained in all things. The true mechanic looks through Nature, and obtains a conviction of its primitive and original condition: and also from Nature forward and upward, through the Spheres of future and eternal progression, and spiritual development. If he has not a comprehension, he has still an irresistible conviction, of these things. He observes cause, effect, and end, in all things. He can contemplate the state which the natural progress of all things tends to develop. Original design is not manifested, without means to produce an end. He arrives at the conclusion that there cannot be too much activity nor too much rest; that there cannot be illegitimate or catastrophic productions, as arising from the general law and motions of Nature.** He will not take the details and minutia for general and universal truths.
## 19: Davis (1847) 302 [1]

>The conclusion drawn from this reasoning must be irresistible, since Nature presents indications which constantly carry the mind through its connected chains of progression to a true conception of a First Existence, and of that which is to be produced. There must be a Beginning, and also an Ultimate: and of this all things afford demonstration to the mind.
## 20: Davis (1847) 320 [1]

>δ 40. And while admiring the wisdom as seen and felt in all things around and above, the mind is impressed still more deeply, and with a clearer perception, with an attribute still more perfect, viz., that of GOODNESS! The incalculable number of worlds which the mind has previously contemplated, with their power of action and wise adjustment of motion, display goodness and design in all their various spheres and states of activity. Goodness is manifested in the fact that each law of a positive nature produces effects of a negative nature; and the equilibrium existing between all motions and forces, causes the principle of goodness to be displayed from the very centre to the circumference of their united actions. And also all the palaetiological sciences, when traced to the present time, or retraced to causes anterior, show the constant adaptation and succession of parts serving as agents and instruments to produce future effects, and which produce others still, until the whole, up to the formation of Man. presents a united chain of progression, —a system of concentric circles of development, —　and the Whole displays beauty, purpose, and design. Each successive circle evinces an infinite amount of power, wisdom, and goodness, until all combined produce Man as an Ultimate —　and that these all were essential principles and operations carried through Nature, for the very purpose of producing this sublime Result!

>The natural developments of the earth, from the grosser stages up to the animal creation, unfold one united and harmonious chain of progression. And Life, Sensation, and Intelligence, have also followed in their respective orders, as the legitimate results of inherent and eternal laws. Throughout the whole vegetable kingdom, there is observed between different forms a constant giving to and taking from each other of particles, in order that one may sustain another, and that thus the kingdom as a whole may be sustained: and thus also is developed the truth of universal Reciprocation, Kindness, and Mercy.
## 22: Davis (1847) 694 [1]

>It is now manifest to every enlarged understanding, that the lowest typifies the highest; and the very moment you conceive of such a representation, all idea of opposites is annihilated. And as the first must exist before the ultimate, so all things must harmonize perfectly, and conform to the established law of universal and eternal progression. Therefore opposites do not exist; but that which is gross, and imperfect, and apparently opposed to higher developments, merely has not progressed to the standard of perfection that we have erected.

>But the close of the carboniferous era is evidently a great consummation as affecting the earthy, mineral, vegetable, and animal forms.

>Who now can read with undisturbed feelings the records of the barbarous massacres, inhuman persecutions, and unnatural and corrupt conditions, that are contained in the history of every nation upon the face of the earth? Who can contemplate the persecutions of centuries past with feelings of pleasure or complacency? Who among the inhabitants of the whole earth can with feelings of pleasure peruse the records of the destructive and immoral proceedings of chieftains, potentates, kings, popes, and emperors, who were uplifted in their own minds and wielded the almost omnipotent influence of a superficial and chimerical theology? Have not ingenious and designing men appealed to the mythological gods of their respective nations to sanctify their despotic governments? Has not one chieftain after another proceeded in the same manner to carry out his misdirected and unnatural desires, at the absolute sacrifice of all morality, and of all natural and divine principles? O Man, whom Nature by her immortal energies has created! Can you not now see the towering monuments erected from the materials of past history, to remind subsequent generations of the results of the misdirection of man's faculties and the pollution of his internal possessions? Do you not now see that these monuments will be reared still higher by generations yet unborn, if you do not exert your powers to remove their foundations, and to erect in their stead the temple of light, liberty, peace, and righteousness? Remain unmoved, and the great ocean of ignorance, folly, and imbecility, will rise to its highest tide, and you will be but floating particles upon its surface. But exert your powers as truth and duty require, and the sparkling rill of human progress will glide onward through the many recesses of social existence, and its many tributaries will all converge to form one grand stream of natural thought and affection, and this will flow onward until it is merged in the great ocean of universal knowledge and peace. And this ocean will flow onward with a tide that shall never ebb, throughout the realms of the immortal spheres!

>Verbal, physical, hieroglyphical expression, is external, superficial, deceptive, and injurious to the human race. The present languages and dialects of the various nations of the earth have arisen entirely as a consequence of the misdirection of the sentient faculties and of the judgment, which so unhappily befell the first-born of the human species. But as language is connected inseparably with the origin of thoughts, it will be further considered connectedly as I proceed to notice the origin of the very many superficial, unnatural, misdirected thoughts which are at the present time obstructing the rising tide of human progress. And in this connection will the origin of language and its improper, unholy, and corrupting tendencies, be further explained.

>The law of eternal progression also governs the constant development of all forms, both of a material and spiritual nature. And from the tendencies of this law flow all affinities, affections, relations, forms, and degrees of refinement. So each law develops forces and tendencies corresponding to the peculiarities of the forms that need to be actuated and governed unchangeably. Then it is proved that the soul of man (which is himself, with its form (which is its body), is an organized essence, such as cannot be annihilated or lost as to its identity. For the dissimilarity of men not only establishes their identity in respect to the outer, but also in respect to the inner. And being thus differently combined, they cannot associate with each other in such a manner as to become individually lost in a general commingling mass: but each, according to the law of eternal association, must necessarily preserve his own identity. And men will approach each other's spheres only as they are mutually congenial on the outer, in all worlds of spiritual existence, as well as in the physical world.

All spirits and angels are of the human races, and these occupy earths innumerable, from; which they ascend through all the Spheres to this, the Super-Celestial habitation. Here they have combined all the perfections that have been uniformly unfolding while passing through the ascending Spheres or stages of eternal progression. This Sphere is the great ultimate of all beauty, and the crown of all loveliness and purity. Yea, it is the highest point of angelic loveliness.

>“No, worlds are also subject to the law of progress. Like yours, all have started out by being inferior, and the Earth will undergo a transformation similar to what has occurred on countless other worlds. It will become an earthly paradise when the people who inhabit it have become good.”

>The spirits who now teach the dogma of multiple corporeal lives reaffrm a theory that was born in the earliest ages of history, and that has maintained a position of importance up to the present day for a vast majority of people. However, they present this dogma in a manner that is more rational, more compliant with the natural law of progress, and more in harmony with the wisdom of the Creator by stripping away the embellishments and exaggerations added by superstition. A circumstance worthy of note is the fact that it is not in this book alone that the doctrine in question has been instructed in recent years. Even before its release, numerous publications of a similar nature had already been circulated in various countries, and their number has greatly increased since. Here we may ask why it is that the statements of all spirits are not in agreement. We will revisit this matter later.

>What current doctrine can solve these problems? If we acknowledge our consecutive lives, all these problems are solved in compliance with Divine justice. What we are unable to complete or do in one life, we accomplish in another. Thus, no one escapes the law of progress. Everyone is rewarded according to his or her own merit, and no one is excluded from the ultimate attainment of supreme happiness, regardless of the obstacles they must overcome on the journey to get there.

>The purpose of a mission is always good. Whether as spirits or incarnate beings, they are expected to help advance the progress of humanity, nations and individuals alike, within a more or less extensive range of ideas. They pave the way for specifc events and oversee the success of specifc things. Some spirits may have a mission that is narrower in scope, and are considered personal or even localized. They help the sick, the dying or the suffering, serving as a guide and protector, and helping them find their way by their guidance or the honest thoughts they suggest.There are as many spirit missions as there are interests, whether in the physical world or in the spirit world. Each spirit advances according to how it accomplishes the task with which it has been entrusted.570. Do spirits always understand the plans they must carry out?
## 32: Kardec (1857) 853 [1]

>Incarnate spirits have occupations intrinsic to the nature of their physical existence. When errant or dematerialized, their occupations are proportionate to their degree of advancement. Some of them travel from world to world, acquiring education and preparing for a new incarnation. More advanced ones devote themselves to progress of humanity by directing the course of events, and suggesting promising ideas. They assist incarnates of genius who help humankind as a whole advance.Others incarnate with a mission of progress.Others watch over individuals, families, societies, cities, countries, and populations, and become their guardian angels, protective spirits and familiar spirits.Still others supervise the phenomena of nature, of which they are the immediate agents. The lower ranking spirits busy themselves with our engagements, and take part in our pleasures.Impure and imperfect spirits suffer while waiting for the moment when God will give them the means of advancing. If they cause harm to others, it is out of spite of the happiness that they are not yet able to enjoy.

>“Of course. Throughout the course of time, there have been those who have received this mission in every age. They are higher spirits, who have been incarnated for the purpose of advancing human progress.”
## 34: Kardec (1857) 1051 [1]

>“No. Humankind must always progress, and cannot return to the state of infancy. If they progress because it is God has willed it. An assumption that people can revert to the primitive condition is to deny the law of progress.”
## 35: Kardec (1857) 1147 [1]

>Fatalism, as commonly understood, assumes a prior and binding predestination of all the events of human life, regardless of their importance. If this were true, people would be machines without a will of their own. What would be the purpose of intelligence, if it were always overruled in all its action by the power of destiny? This destroys any sense of moral freedom. There would be no such thing as human accountability, and consequently there would be no distinction between good and evil, or virtue and crime. God, who is supremely just, could not punish people for faults that they were forced to commit, nor could they be rewarded for virtues that they do not merit. This would contradict the law of progress because humans would not be motivated to improve their position since their actions could make it neither better nor worse.
## 36: Kardec (1857) 1200 [1]

>905. There are great books that are full of moral teachings from which their authors have not derived much moral profit despite helping the progress of humanity. Is the good those authors do by their writings be counted to them as spirits?
## 37: Kardec (1857) 1214 [1]

>Praiseworthy efforts are being put forward to help advance the progress of humanity. Kind and charitable thoughts are encouraged, stimulated and honored now more than at any other time in history, and yet selfishness continues to plague society. It is a social disease that affects everyone, of which everyone is more or less the victim, and should be fought like any other epidemic. To this end, we must emulate the methodology of a skilled physician and begin by tracing the disease to its origin. We must seek out, in every division of human society, from families to nations, from the hut to the palace, all the obvious and obscure causes and influences that sustain and foster selfishness. Once the causes of the disease are established, the remedy presents itself spontaneously through the combined efforts of all, and the virus is destroyed gradually. The cure may take a long time, because the causes are numerous, but it is not impossible. That being said, it can only be successful by getting to the root of the evil; that is, through education. Not the education that aims only to educate people; but the one that also aims to make them moral individuals.
## 38: Kardec (1857) 1348 [1]

>“There are some whose repentance is delayed for a very long time. Yet, to assume that they will never evolve is contradicting the law of progress, and asserting that a child will never become an adult.”
## 39: Kardec (1857) 1385 [1]

>The progress of humanity results from the practical application of the laws of justice, love and charity. These laws are founded on the certainty of a future life. If we eliminate this certainty, we remove the cornerstone. These laws are the basis for all others, as they comprise all the conditions of human happiness. They alone can cure the plagues of society, and we may judge, by comparing the various ages and populations of the Earth, the improvement that takes place in the conditions of social life, as these laws are better understood and better carried out. If even just a partial and incomplete application of these laws manages to produce a noticeable improvement, imagine what it will be like when they become the basis for all social institutions! Could this be possible? Yes, because as human beings take ten steps forward, it is clear that they can take twenty, and so on. In that vein, the future can be inferred from the past. We see that the hostilities between different nations begin to soften, the barriers that separate them are toppled by civilization, and people are joining hands from one end of the world to the other. A larger measure of justice governs international laws. Wars occur less frequently and do not exclude humane feelings and attitudes. Consistency is established gradually in relationships, while the distinctions of races and classes are erased. People of different religious beliefs eventually set aside their preconceived notions so that they may unite with one another in worshiping one God. We are talking about the nations that are at the forefront of civilization (see nos. 789-793). In all these relations, we are still far from perfection. There are still many ruins to be torn down before the last vestiges of barbarism are cleared away, but can those ruins withstand the relentless action of progress, which, in itself is a law of nature? If the present generation is more advanced than the last, why shouldn’t the next be even more advanced than ours? This will always be the case by the force of circumstances. First, as each generation passes away it takes supporters of old injustices and abuses with it. Therefore, society is gradually rebuilt with new members who have thrown aside antiquated prejudices. Second, when people want progress, they study the obstacles that impede it and focus on the means for removing them. The progressive movement of human society is irrefutable, therefore progress undoubtedly continues in the future. It is in the nature of human beings to want to be happy. We want progress to increase our happiness, otherwise progress has no purpose. Where would we be if progress did not improve our position? When we obtain all the gratification that we can attain through intellectual progress, we realize that we have not obtained complete happiness, and that this happiness is impossible without having security in relationships. We can only obtain this security through moral progress. Thus, by the force of circumstances, we will work tirelessly for that end, and Spiritism will offer us the most effective means of reaching that goal.

>* Mrs. H made a great many verses ; but, as they are not poetical in the original, and would be still less so translated, we omit them. — Translator. or dreaming. Clairvoyance is a state of the most perfect vigilance, because then the inner spiritual man is disentangled and set free from the body. I would rather, therefore, denominate sleepwaking the coming forward of the innerman, or the spiritual growth of man. At these moments the spirit is quite free and able to separate itself from the soul and body, and go where it will, like a flash of lightning. The sleepwaker is then incapable of any ungodly act ; though his soul be impure, he can neither lie nor deceive. I should call this the third stage of clearseeing. In the second stage, which is inferior, the soul and spirit come forth together — not the spirit alone, as in the former. There is a still inferior state, in which the soul unites itself with the spirit ; and, as no soul is quite pure, the seeing is here imperfect. The lowest stage of all may be considered as an excited condition of the nervous system, and is a state which appears more or less in ordinary life. It resembles that prophetic power that some men, doubtless, are endowed with ; but, in the case of a sleepwaker, the faculty is stronger, and more regular.

>It is this development of the Man that must have been intended by the Apostle Paul when he said : — ‘Till we all come . . . to the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a Perfect Man, unto the measure of the stature, of the fulness of Christ.’ That is, that Man must grow sufficiently in his Spiritual growth, that he may attain to that stature where his head will come into contact with his Kether — that is, unto the Knowledge of his Higher Self.

>It is not necessary to study Occultism in order to become good, — but rather to become wise. The means which you are taught to employ are calculated to equilibrate the spiritual nature and implement spiritual growth.

>Look back, then, each one of you, to anything in the past year that has been akin to crucifixion, no matter how small, and rejoice that you have, even to a small extent, been following the Master and walking in His footsteps. For the divine law will work in each one of you, and after your crucifixion shall be a joyful resurrection, the greater the struggle and pain, the greater will be your joy and your own resurrection. Search your own hearts then, for the Holy Spirit will speak in each one of you without fail and without error. Having then, O my companions, been each one broken up and tested as ye were able to bear it, we come to a time of fresh life-effort, and the year shall be called ‘The Year of New Beginnings’, for the seed of a new life has been sown in each of you. See to it that it grow and bear fruit, for the Holy Spirit of God needs your co-operation, your desire, your imagination, your will. And remember, you who are attracted more to knowledge and the cultivation of brain power, that if ye see not in this also a development of character, a spiritual growth, it is empty and worthless. The desire to know more than your neighbours, to be more advanced, as it is said, is an evil thing, and will inevitably stop you, and finally, if yielded to, will draw you down, and you will come under the domination of an evil lower self whose power it will be difficult to escape from.

>For those spirits now going through what is sometimes termed the cycle of Incarnations — the periods between two Incarnations are by far the most real and important parts of their existence — are in fact their true life. Those who teach that the Ego after an incarnation sleeps in Devachan, entertained by unreal illusions, or suffers in Avitchi — or wanders in Kama Loka — are in error, seeing only part of the truth — still more so are they who teach that the Soul’s final and eternal destiny is fixed at the moment of death — for which there is no warrant in any revelation. For the truth is that in what ye earth dwellers term physical death the Ego returns to its full normal life, wherein indeed there is sleep, and dream, and suffering, and joy, yet these things are but part of its fullness.
## 45: King (1987) 460 [1]

>Yet note that these things in themselves are not evil — they form part of the gymnastic apparatus which ye call earthly life — and are hurtful only when an exercise is improperly done. Consider how the weight of a dumb-bell is a good thing — yet if the pupil lets it fall on himself its weight becomes a source of pain and trouble. As we have said, those going through the cycle of Incarnation are as small children — and their friends and guardians are close beside them.

>Human intelligence has had its morning ; its noon will come, and the decline follow, but God will ever be the same. It seems, however, to the dwellers on the earth that the sun rises youthful and timid in the morning, shines with all its power at mid- day, and goes wearied to rest in the evening. Nevertheless, it is earth which revolves while the sun is motionless. Having faith, therefore, in human progress, and in the stability of God, the free man respects religion in its past forms, and no more blasphemes Jupiter than Jehovah ; he still salutes lovingly the radiant image of the Pythian Apollo, and discovers its fraternal resemblance to the glorified countenance of the risen Kedeemer. He believes in the great mission of the Catholic hierarchy, and finds satisfaction in observing the popes of the middle ages who opposed religion as a check upon the absolute power of kings ; but he protests with the revolutionary centuries against the servitude of conscience which would enchain the pontifical keys ; he is more protestant than Luther, since he does not even believe in the infallibility of the Augsbourg Confession, and more catholic than the Pope, for he has no fear that religious unity will be broken by the ill-will of the courts. He trusts in God rather than Roman policy for the salvation of the unity idea ; he respects the old age of the Church, but he has no fear that she will die ; he knows that her apparent death will be a transfiguration and a glorious assumption.

>Here, in its great features, is already an answer to our questions: the Spirit descends by three trinities from the Absolute into Matter (upper hemisphere). It is realized by the trinity X. (Malchut), XI. and XII. (the Equator), and it returns to the Absolute by a trinity of growing synthesis, which constitutes human progress (lower hemisphere).
