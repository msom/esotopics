>‘The consciousness then seems to pass through the symbol to realms beyond it: probably visions and pictures from other planes come on to the hypersensitive brain centres. The sensation is as if looking at a series of moving pictures, and although there are beings with whom one can converse and animals one can dominate, there is no more solidity than in a cinema film. In time, however, the sensitivity of the brain increases, and one gains the power of actually going to the scenes of the visions and seeing them as three dimensional — indeed, one actually becomes capable of doing things in the vision and producing effects upon it. This is what is technically known as ‘Travelling in the Spirit Vision’ and whether it is more than an extension of the power of seeing the moving pictures on the Sphere of Sensation (the akashic envelope) is difficult to determine. The stages of Travelling in the Spirit Vision are as follows: —

>Whether it is more than an extension of the power of perceiving the pictures on the Sphere of Sensation or Akashic envelope is very difficult to determine. The sensation, however, to me personally is first to become, as it were, dimly conscious of a figure walking among the scenes of the new country — or the Astral Plane — gradually to become conscious that it is my own figure I am looking at — gradually, as it were, to be able to look through the eyes — and feel with the sensations of this doppel ganger. Further to be able consciously to direct its motions, to control it, to inhabit it, and in this body to be able to visit the scenes and persons I had previously only looked at, as it were, through a telescope.

>‘It is as though consciousness was extruded from one’s own body and taken over a body either created for the purpose or invoked out of the astral sphere. It seems probably that as the Sphere of Sensation reflects everything on the physical plane it contains a reflection of the material body of the percipient. If this is so it would follow that the body could be made to travel within the Sphere of Sensation and visit all things reflected therein.

>When a man has lived well the astral body evaporates like a pure incense ascending towards the upper regions ; but should he have lived in sin, his astral body, which holds him prisoner, still seeks the objects of its passions, and wishes to return to life. It torments the dreams of young girls, bathes in the steam of spilt blood, and floats about the places where the pleasures of its life elapsed ; it still watches over treasures which it possessed and buried; it expends itself in painful efforts to make fresh material organs and so live again. But the stars draw it up and absorb it ; its feels its intelligence weaken, its memory gradually vanishes, all its being dissolves. . . . Its former vices rise up before it, assume monstrous shapes, and pursue it ; they attack and devour it. ... The unfortunate creature thus successively loses all the members which have ministered to his iniquities ; then he dies a second time and for ever, because he loses his personality and his memory. Souls which are destined to live, but are not yet completely purified, remain captive for a longer or shorter period in the astral body, wherein they are burned by the odic light, which seeks to absorb and dissolve them. It is in order to escape from this body that suffering souls sometimes enter the bodies of the living and therein dwell in that state which Kabbalists term embryonic. Now, it is these aerial bodies which are evoked by necromancy. We enter into connection with larvae, with dead or perishing substances, by this operation. The beings in question, for the most part, cannot speak except by the tingling of our ears produced by the nervous shock to which I have referred, and commonly they can only reason by reflecting our thoughts and our reveries. To behold these strange forms, we must put ourselves in abnormal condition akin to sleep or death, in other words, we must magnetise ourselves and enter into a kind of lucid and waking somnambulism. Then necromancy has real results, and then the evocations of magic can produce actual visions. We have said that in the great magical agent, which is the astral light, there are preserved all impressions of things, all images formed either by rays or reflections ; in this same light our visions come to us, and it is this which intoxicates the insane, and leads away their dormant judgment in pursuit of the most bizarre phantoms. To insure vision without illusion in this light, a powerful will must be with us to isolate reflections and attract rays only. To dream awake is to see in the astral light, and the orgies of the Sabbath, described by so many sorcerers in their criminal trials, came to them solely in this manner. The preparations and the substances used to obtain this result were often horrible, as we shall see in the Ritual, but the result itself was never doubtful. They beheld, they heard, they handled the most abominable, most fantastic, most impossible things. We shall return to this subject in our fifteenth chapter ; at the present moment we are concerned only with the evocations of the dead.

>Let us pass to another maniac who was called Theophrastus Aureolus Bombast and was known in the World of Magic under the famous name of Paracelsus. There is no need to recapitulate what has been said concerning this master in our _Doctrine and Ritual of Transcendental Magic_, but something may be added on the occult medicine restored by Paracelsus. This truly universal medicine is based upon a spacious theory of light, called by adepts fluid or potable gold. Light, that creative agent, the vibrations of which are the movement and life of all things; light, latent in the universal ether, radiating about absorbing centres, which, being saturated thereby, project movement and life in their turn, so forming creative currents; light, astralised in the stars, animalised in animals, humanised in human beings; light, which vegetates in plants, glistens in metals, produces all forms of Nature and equilibrates all by the laws of universal sympathy—this is that light which exhibits the phenomena of magnetism, divined by Paracelsus, which tinctures the blood, being released from the air as it is inhaled and discharged by the hermetic bellows of the lungs. The blood then becomes a true elixir of life, wherein ruby and magnetic globules of vital light float in a slightly gilded fluid. These globules are actual seeds, ready to assume all forms of that world whereof the human body is an abridgment. They can become rarefied and coagulated, so renewing the humours which circulate in the nerves and in the flesh encompassing the bones. They radiate outside, or rather, in rarefying, they are drawn by the currents of light and circulate in the astral body—that interior and luminous body which is dilated by the imagination of ecstatics, so that their blood sometimes colours objects at a distance when these have been penetrated and identified with the astral body. In a special work on occult medicine that which is stated here will be proved, however strange and paradoxical it may seem at first sight to men of science. Such were the bases of medicine as put forward by Paracelsus; he cured by sympathy of light; he administered medicaments not to the outward material body, which is entirely passive, which can be rent and cut up without feeling anything when the astral body has withdrawn, but to the inward medium, to that vehicle which is the source of sensations. The quintessence of these he renewed by sympathetic quintessences. For example, he healed wounds by applying powerful reactives to the spilt blood, thus sending back its physical soul and purified sap to the body. To cure a diseased limb he made a limb of wax and, by will-power, transferred thereto the magnetism of the diseased limb. Then he treated the wax with vitriol, iron and fire, thus reacting by imagination and magnetic correspondence on the sick person himself, to whom the limb of wax had become an appendix and supplement. Paracelsus knew the mysteries of blood; he knew why the priests of Baal made incisions with knives in their flesh, and then brought down fire from heaven; he knew why orientals poured out their blood before a woman to inspire her with physical love; he knew how spilt blood cries for vengeance or mercy and fills the air with angels or demons. Blood is the instrument of dreams and multiplies images in the brain during sleep, because it is full of the Astral Light. Its globules are bisexual, magnetised and metalled, sympathetic and repelling. All forms and images in the world can be evoked from the physical soul or blood.

>Theo. In many ways. The causes of such manifestations are by no means so simple as the Spiritualists would like to believe. Foremost of all, the deus ex machina of the so-called "materializations" is usually the astral body or "double" of the medium or of some one present. This astral body is also the producer or operating force in the manifestations of slate-writing, "Davenport"-like manifestations, and so on.

>Then, maintaining your abstraction from your surroundings, and still concentrating upon the symbol and its correlated ideas, you are to seek a perception of a scene, panorama, or view of a place. This may also be brought on by a sense of tearing open, as a curtain is drawn aside and seeing the ‘within’ of the symbol before you. As the scene dawns upon you, particularise the details, and seek around for objects, and then for beings, entities and persons — attract their attention, call mentally to them by suitable titles and courtesies, and by proper and appropriate signs and symbols, such as the signs of the Grades, Pentagrams, etc. Test them by divine and angelic names, observing their attitude and responses thereto. Thus losing sight of the symbol, you see its inwardness, perceive things as in a mirror by Reflection. In this form of Descrying, note, that you see objects reversed, as to right and left, for which suitable allowance must be made. You project, in this process, part of your own nerve and spirit force upon the symbol, and by this you attract and attach to it more akashic force from the environment, hence the results obtained. If, instead of this Simple Spirit Vision, a ray of yourself is sent and actually goes to a place (astral projection) FLYING ROLL NO. XI

>Astral Projection, although from one point of thought a development of Clairvoyance, yet is from another distinct: in Astral Projection, the Adept emits from his Ego a perceptible ray of his identity, and by cultured and instructed Will, sends it to travel to the place desired, focusses it there, sees there — directly and not by reflection — perceives its bodily home, and re-enters it.

>If, then, everything in the Cosmos is somehow reflected or pictured on each man’s own sphere of sensation, or Akashic. envelope, it follows that if he could but be conscious of the pictures so reflected or imprinted he would at once be possessed of all actual or potential knowledge of everything in the Cosmos, and further assuming that time itself is merely an illusion, and that the reality of things is, as it were, one vast picture along which we travel seeing point after point in succession and producing the idea of lapse of time, then it further follows that the full and complete knowledge of all that is reflected in our sphere of sensation includes all knowledge past, present and future.
## 10: King (1987) 109 [2]

>The reason, then, why we have not such knowledge consciously to ourselves must be from the obtuseness of the Sensorium, the actual physical brain, which cannot perceive the images on the sphere of sensation. If, then, all knowledge lies ■within each man’s own sphere, it is by looking within, or intuition, that such knowledge is made available.
## 11: King (1987) 110 [2]

>Know thyself and thou wilt know everything. But seeing that the brain and sensorium are physical, it is necessary at first to use physical means to produce the sensitiveness necessary to consciously perceive the images on the Sphere of Sensation. And the readiest and safest means is the use of a symbol. This is familiar in everyday life, but so much so as to escape notice.
## 12: King (1987) 123 [2]

>It seems, however, almost more probable that as the Sphere of Sensation reflects everything that is in the material Universe so it must needs contain a reflection also of the material body of the percipient and if this be so it is not hard to suppose that such reflection can be made to travel about within the Sphere of Sensation and visit all things therein reflected with as much ease (or more) as the will of the man can make his physical body travel to material places on the earth.
## 13: King (1987) 195 [2]

>Secondly, as to the extension of our powers of perception beyond the plane of matter into the super-sensuous world, you must remember that the Theosophical view is the correct one and that our Thinking Personalities are incarnated into these material bodies and are acting therefore under the consequent disadvantages. It is because the mind is immersed in matter that its powers are so limited, and we can readily understand that a mind freed from constraints of the body would enjoy vastly enlarged powers. Thus, although our senses are the means by which we perceive; yet at the same time they necessarily limit the extent of our perception. It is therefore our material bodily organs which circumscribe as well as bestow. All of our five senses are capable of enlargement and development. It is however the sense of sight which we most commonly seek thus to develop. Having intellectually learned the laws which relate to sight and colour we are encouraged to practice Clairvoyance and to seek to see beyond material things into the plane most adjacent to us — the Astral, and then we seek to travel in the Spirit Vision through the confusions and the uncertainties of the Astral into the planes beyond.

>The Consciousness after death depends on the state of the Astral body here. In some cases it is weak and weary from its earthly pilgrimage here and requires a long sleep — in other cases it has periods of probation to undergo — or of purgation — but there are cases where the Astral enters at once on a career of help to those on earth — and to those also on its own astral plane.

>(c) The “Sea of Fire” is, then, the Super‐Astral (i.e., Noumenal) Light, the first radiation from the Root Mûlaprakriti, Undifferentiated Cosmic Substance, which becomes Astral Matter. It is also called the “Fiery Serpent,” as above described. If the student bears in mind that there is but One Universal Element, which is infinite, unborn, and undying and that all the rest—as in the world of phenomena—are but so many various differentiated aspects and transformations (correlations, they are now called) of that One, from macrocosmical down to microcosmical effects, from super‐human down to human and sub‐human beings, the totality, in short, of objective existence—then the first and chief difficulty will disappear and Occult Cosmology may be mastered. Thus in the Egyptian also as in the Indian Theogony there was a Concealed Deity, the ONE, and a creative, androgynous god; Shoo being the god of creation, and Osiris in his original primary form, the god “whose name is unknown.”

>“Thought is matter”: not of course, however, in the sense of the German Materialist Moleschott, who assures us that “thought is the movement of matter”—a statement of almost unparalleled absurdity. Mental states and bodily states are utterly contrasted as such. But that does not affect the position that every thought, in addition to its physical accompaniment (brain‐change), exhibits an objective—though to us supersensuously objective—aspect on the astral plane.

>“Lead the life necessary for the acquisition of such knowledge and powers, and Wisdom will come to you naturally. Whenever you are able to attune your consciousness to any of the seven chords of ‘Universal Consciousness,’ those chords that run along the sounding‐board of Kosmos, vibrating from one Eternity to another; when you have studied thoroughly the ‘Music of the Spheres,’ then only will you become quite free to share your knowledge with those with whom it is safe to do so. Meanwhile, be prudent. Do not give out the great Truths that are the inheritance of the future Races, to our present generation. Do not attempt to unveil the secret of Being and Non‐Being to those unable to see the hidden meaning of Apollo’s Heptachord, the lyre of the radiant god, in each of the seven strings of which dwelleth the Spirit, Soul and Astral Body of the Kosmos, whose shell only has now fallen into the hands of modern Science.... Be prudent, we say, prudent and wise, and above all take care what those who learn from you believe in; lest by deceiving themselves they deceive others, ... for such is the fate of every truth with which men are, as yet, unfamiliar....

>I use the word ether in its general sense as meaning a very light, vaporous or gaseous matter; I use it, in short, as the astronomer uses it when he speaks of the ether of Space, by which he means a subtle but material medium.... When I speak of a nervous ether, I do not convey that the ether is existent in nervous structure only: I believe truly that it is a special part of the nervous organization; but, as nerves pass into all structures that have capacities for movement and sensibilities, so the nervous ether passes into all such parts; and as the nervous ether is, according to my view, a direct product from blood, so we may look upon it as a part of the atmosphere of the blood.... The evidence in favour of the existence of an elastic medium pervading the nervous matter and capable of being influenced by simple pressure is all- convincing.... In nervous structure there is, unquestionably, a true nervous fluid, as our predecessors taught. The precise chemical (?) composition of this fluid is not yet well known; the physical characters of it have been little studied. Whether it moves in currents, we do not know; whether it circulates, we do not know; whether it is formed in the centres and passes from them to the nerves, or whether it is formed everywhere where blood enters nerve, we do not know. The exact uses of the fluid we do not consequently know. It occurs to my mind, however, that the veritable fluid of nervous matter is not of itself sufficient to act as the subtle medium that connects the outer with the inner universe of man and animal. I think—and this is the modification I suggest to the older theory—there must be another form of matter present during life; a matter which exists in the condition of vapour or gas, which pervades the whole nervous organism, surrounds as an enveloping atmosphere each molecule of nervous structure, and is the medium of all motion, communicated to and from the nervous centres.... When it is once fairly presented to the mind that during life there is in the animal body a finely diffused form of matter, a vapour filling every part—and even stored in some parts; a matter constantly renewed by the vital chemistry; a matter as easily disposed of as the breath, after it has served its purpose—a new flood of light breaks on the intelligence.

>Let us now state the manner in which visions operate. All forms correspond to ideas, and there is no idea which has not its proper and peculiar form. The primordial light, which is the vehicle of all ideas, is the mother of all forms, and transmits them from emanation to emanation, merely Diminished or modified according to the density of the media. Secondary forms are reflections which return to the font of the emanated light. The forms of objects, being a modification of light, remain in the light where the reflection consigns them. Hence the astral light, or terrestrial fluid, which we call the great magnetic agent, is saturated with all kinds of images or reflections. Now, our soul can evoke these, and refer them to its diaphane, as the kabbalists term it. Such images are always present to us, and are only effaced by the more powerful impressions of reality during waking hours, or by preoccupation of the mind, which makes our imagination inattentive to the fluidic panorama of the astral light. When we sleep, this spectacle presents itself spontaneously before us, and in this way dreams are produced dreams vague and incoherent if some governing will do not remain active during the sleep, giving, even unconsciously to our intelligence, a direction to the dream, which then transforms into vision. Animal magnetism is nothing else but an artificial sleep produced by the voluntary or enforced union of two wills, one of which is awake while the other slumbers that is, one of which directs the other in the choice of reflections for the transformation of dreams into visions, and the attainment of truth by means of images. Thus, somnambulists do not actually travel to the place where they are sent by the magnetiser ; they evoke its images in the astral light, and can behold nothing which does not exist in that light. The astral light has a direct action on the nerves, which are its conductors in the animal economy, transmitting it to the brain, whence also, in the state of somnambulism, it is possible to see by means of the nerves, without being dependent on radiant light, the astral fluid being a latent light, in the same way that physics recognise the existence of a latent caloric.

>So far he is right enough. But when the great authority of the Western Kabalists adds that, nevertheless, “it is not the immortal Spirit, as the Indian Hierophants have imagined”—we answer, that he slanders the said Hierophants, as they have said nothing of the kind; for even the Purânic exoteric writings flatly contradict the assertion. No Hindû has ever mistaken Prakriti—the Astral Light being only above the lowest plane of Prakriti, the Material Kosmos—for the “immortal Spirit.” Prakriti is ever called Mâyâ, Illusion, and is doomed to disappear with the rest, the Gods included, at the hour of the Pralaya. As it is shown that Âkâsha is not even the Ether, least of all then, we imagine, can it be the Astral Light. Those unable to penetrate beyond the dead letter of the Purânas, have occasionally confused Âkâsha with Prakriti, with Ether, and even with the visible Sky! It is true also that those who have invariably translated the term Âkâsha by “Ether”—Wilson, for instance—finding it called “the material cause of sound” possessing, moreover, this one single property, have ignorantly imagined it to be “material,” in the physical sense. True, again, that if the characteristics are accepted literally, then, since nothing material or physical, and therefore conditioned and temporary, can be immortal—according to metaphysics and philosophy—it would follow that Âkâsha is neither infinite nor immortal. But all this is erroneous, since both the words Pradhâna, Primeval Matter, and Sound, as a property, have been misunderstood; the former term (Pradhâna) being certainly synonymous with Mûlaprakriti and Âkâsha, and the latter (Sound) with the Verbum, the Word or the Logos. This is easy to demonstrate; for it is shown in the following sentence from Vishnu Purâna. “There was neither day nor night, nor sky, nor earth, nor darkness, nor light, nor any other thing, save only One, unapprehensible by intellect, or that which is Brahman, and Pums, [Spirit] and Pradhâna [Primordial Matter].”

>Yet they all made a difference between the good and the bad Serpent (the Astral Light of the Kabalists)—between the former, the embodiment of divine Wisdom in the region of the Spiritual, and the latter, Evil, on the plane of Matter. For the Astral Light, or the Ether, of the ancient Pagans—the name Astral Light is quite modern—is Spirit‐Matter. Beginning with the pure spiritual plane, it becomes grosser as it descends, until it becomes Mâyâ, or the tempting and deceitful Serpent on our plane.

>The hypothesis of Metcalfe respecting sun‐force and earth‐force is not only very simple, but most fascinating.... Here are two elements in the universe, the one is ponderable matter.... The second element is the all‐pervading ether, solar fire. It is without weight, substance, form, or colour; it is matter infinitely divisible, and its particles repel each other; its rarity is such that we have no word, except ether, by which to express it. It pervades and fills space, but alone it too is quiescent—dead. We bring together the two elements, the inert matter, the self‐repulsive ether [?] and thereupon dead [?] ponderable matter is vivified; [Ponderable matter may be inert but never dead—this is Occult Law.] ... through the particles of the ponderable substance the ether [Ether’s second principle] penetrates, and, so penetrating, it combines with the ponderable particles and holds them in mass, holds them together in bond of union; they are dissolved in the ether.

>It is as platinum to hydrogen gas. Molecular separation of air brings us to the first sub‐division only; inter‐molecular, to the second; atomic, to the third; inter‐atomic, to the fourth; etheric, to the fifth; and inter‐etheric, to the sixth sub- division, or positive association with luminiferous ether. In my introductory argument I have contended that this is the vibratory envelope of all atoms. In my definition of atom I do not confine myself to the sixth sub‐division where this luminiferous ether is developed in its crude form, as far as my researches prove. I think this idea will be pronounced by the physicists of the present day, a wild freak of the imagination. Possibly, in time, a light may fall upon this theory that will bring its simplicity forward for scientific research. At present I can only compare it to some planet in a dark space, where the light of the sun of science has not yet reached it.... I assume that sound, like odour, is a real substance of unknown and wonderful tenuity, emanating from a body where it has been induced by percussion and throwing out absolute corpuscles of matter, inter‐atomic particles, with velocity of 1,120 feet per second; in vacuo 20,000. The substance which is thus disseminated is a part and parcel of the mass agitated, and, if kept under this agitation continuously, would, in the course of a certain cycle of time, become thoroughly absorbed by the atmosphere; or, more truly, would pass through the atmosphere to an elevated point of tenuity corresponding to the condition of sub‐division that governs its liberation from its parent body.... The sounds from vibratory forks, set so as to produce etheric chords, while disseminating their tones (compound), permeate most thoroughly all substances that come under the range of their atomic bombardment. The clapping of a bell in vacuo liberates these atoms with the same velocity and volume as one in the open air; and were the agitation of the bell kept up continuously for a few millions of centuries it would thoroughly return to its primitive element; and, if the chamber were hermetically sealed, and strong enough, the vacuous volume surrounding the bell would be brought to a pressure of many thousands of pounds to the square inch, by the tenuous substance evolved. In my estimation, sound truly defined is the disturbance of atomic equilibrium, rupturing actual atomic corpuscles; and the substance thus liberated must certainly be a certain order of etheric flow. Under these conditions, is it unreasonable to suppose that, if this flow were kept up, and the body thus robbed of its element, it would in time disappear entirely? All bodies are formed primitively from this highly tenuous ether, animal, vegetable, and mineral, and they are only returned to their high gaseous condition when brought under a state of differential equilibrium.... As regards odour, we can only get some definite idea of its extreme and wondrous tenuity by taking into consideration that a large area of atmosphere can be impregnated for a long series of years from a single grain of musk; which, if weighed after that long interval, will be found to be not appreciably diminished. The great paradox attending the flow of odorous particles is that they can be held under confinement in a glass vessel! Here is a substance of much higher tenuity than the glass that holds it, and yet it cannot escape. It is as a sieve with its meshes large enough to pass marbles, and yet holding fine sand which cannot pass through; in fact, a molecular vessel holding an atomic substance. This is a problem that would confound those who stop to recognize it. But infinitely tenuous as odour is, it holds a very crude relation to the substance of sub- division that governs a magnetic flow (a flow of sympathy, if you please to call it so). This sub‐division comes next to sound, but is above sound. The action of the flow of a magnet coincides somewhat to the receiving and distributing portion of the human brain, giving off at all times a depreciating ratio of the amount received. It is a grand illustration of the control of mind over matter, which gradually depreciates the physical till dissolution takes place. The magnet on the same ratio gradually loses its power and becomes inert. If the relations that exist between mind and matter could be equated and so held, we would live on in our physical state eternally, as there would be no physical depreciation. But this physical depreciation leads, at its terminus, to the source of a much higher development—viz., the liberation of the pure ether from the crude molecular; which, in my estimation, is to be much desired.

>Yetzirah is the Astral Light, which is especially the medium wherein operate the Ethers of the Elements under the presidency of the Planets: I use the expression Ether of the Elements in order to convey the significance of the Hermetic conception of the ‘Elements’. The Elements of the ancients (called respectively Fire, Water, Air and Earth) are not at all the physical Elements but the subtle Ethers underlying these, — the presence of which is necessary before the gross Elements can be manifested.

>Man is the microcosm or little world, ant centres the doctrine of analogies, whatsoever is in th is reproduced in the small. Hence we have of fluidic attraction and projection the brain, the heart or epigastric region, and the genital organ. Each of these instruments is double in other words, we find the suggestion of the triad therein. Each attracts on one side and repels on another. It is by means of these apparatuses that we place ourselves in communication with the universal fluid transmitted into us by the nervous system. These three centres are, moreover, the seat of the threefold magnetic operation, as we shall explain elsewhere. When the magus has attained lucidity, whether through the mediation of a pythoness, or by his own development, he communicates and directs at will the magnetic vibrations in the whole mass of the astral light, the currents of which he divines by means of the magic rod, which is a perfected divining rod. By the aid of these vibrations he influences the nervous system of persons surrendered to his action, accelerates or suspends the currents of life, soothes or tortures, heals or hurts ; in fine, slays or brings to life. . . . Here, however, we pause in presence of the smile of incredulity. Let us permit it to enjoy the cheap triumph of denying what it does not know. We shall demonstrate later on that death is always preceded by a lethargic sleep, and only takes place gradually ; that resurrection is possible in certain cases ; that lethargy is a real, but uncompleted, death ; and that the final paroxysm is in many cases subsequent to inhumation. This, however, is not the subject of the present chapter. We now affirm that a lucid will can act upon the mass of the astral light, and, in concurrence with other wills, which it absorbs and draws along, can determine great and irresistible currents. We say also that the astral light condenses or rarefies in proportion as currents accumulate, more or less, at certain centres. When it is deficient in the energy required for the support of life, diseases accompanied by sudden decomposition follow, of the kind which baffle physicians. There is no other cause, by example, in the case of cholera-morbus, and the swarms of animalcule observed or supposed by some specialists may be the effect rather than the cause. Cholera should therefore be treated by insufflation, did not the operator thereby run the chance of an exchange with the patient, which would be very formidable for himself. Every intelligent effort of will is a projection of the human fluid or light, and here it is needful to distinguish the human from the astral light, and animal from universal magnetism. In making use of the word fluid, we employ an accepted expression, and would make ourselves understood in this manner, but we are far from deciding that the latent light is a fluid. Everything prompts us, on the contrary, to prefer the system of vibrations in the explanation of this phenomenal subject. However it may be, the light in question, being the instrument of life, cleaves naturally to all living centres, attaches itself to the nucleus of planets, even as to the heart of man and by the heart we understand magically the great sympathetic identifying itself with the individual life of the being which it animates, and it is by this quality of sympathetic assimilation that it distributes itself without confusion.

>The phenomena which have quite recently perturbed America and Europe, as regards table-turning and fluidic manifestations, are simply magnetic currents at the beginning of their formation, appeals on the part of nature inviting us, for the good of humanity, to re-establish the great sympathetic and religious chains. As a fact, stagnation in the astral light would mean death to the human race, and torpor in this secret agent has already been manifested by alarming symptoms of decomposition and death. For example, cholera-morbus, the potato disease, and the blight of the grape, are traceable solely to this cause, as the two young shepherds of la Salette saw darkly and symbolically in their dream. The unlooked-for credit which awaited their narrative, and the vast concourse of pilgrims attracted by a statement so singular and at the same time so vague as that of these two children without instruction and almost without morality, are proofs of the magnetic reality of the fact, and the fluidic tendency of the earth itself to operate the cure of its inhabitants. Superstitions are instinctive, and all that is instinctive is founded in the very nature of things, to which fact the sceptics of all times have given insufficient attention. We attribute, then, all the strange phenomena of table-turning to the universal magnetic agent in search of a chain of enthusiasms with a view to the formation of fresh currents. The force of itself is blind, but it can be directed by the will of man, and is influenced by prevailing opinions. This universal fluid if we decide to regard it as a fluid being the common medium of all nervous organisms, and the vehicle of all sensitive vibrations, establishes an actual physical solidarity between impressionable persons, and transmits from one to another the impressions of imagination and of thought. The movement of the inert object, determined by the undulations of the universal agent, obeys the ruling impression, and reproduces in its revelations at one time all the lucidity of the most wonderful visions, and at another all the eccentricity and falsehood of the most vague and incoherent dreams. The blows resounding on furniture, the clattering of dishes, the self -playing of musical instruments, are illusions produced by the same cause. The miracles of the convulsionaries of Saint Medard were of the same order, and seemed frequently to suspend the laws of nature. On the one hand, exaggeration produced by fascination, which is the special quality of intoxication occasioned by congestions of the astral light; on the other, actual oscillations or movements impressed upon inert matter by the subtle and universal agent of motion and life. Such is the sole foundation of these occurrences which look so marvellous, as we may easily demonstrate at will by reproducing, in accordance with rules laid down in the Ritual, the most astounding of these phenomena, establishing, as can be done quite simply, the absence of trickery, hallucination, or error.

>There is a whole poem on the pregenetic battles fought by the growing planets before the final formation of Cosmos, thus accounting for the seemingly disturbed position of the systems of several planets; the plane of the satellites of some (of Neptune and Uranus, for instance, of which the ancients knew nothing, it is said) being tilted over, thus giving them an appearance of retrograde motion. These planets are called the Warriors, the Architects, and are accepted by the Roman Church as the leaders of the heavenly Hosts, thus showing the same traditions. Having evolved from Cosmic Space, the Sun, we are taught—before the final formation of the primaries and the annulation of the planetary nebulæ—drew into the depths of his mass all the cosmic vitality he could, threatening to engulf his weaker “Brothers,” before the law of attraction and repulsion was finally adjusted; after which, he began feeding on “the Mother’s refuse and sweat”; in other words, on those portions of Æther (the “Breath of the Universal Soul”), of the existence and constitution of which Science is as yet absolutely ignorant. As a theory of this kind has been propounded by Sir William Grove, who theorizes that the systems “are gradually changing by atmospheric additions or subtractions, or by accretions and diminutions arising from nebular substance,” and again that “the sun may condense gaseous matter as it travels in space, and so heat may be produced”—the archaic teaching seems scientific enough, even in this age. Mr. W. Mattieu Williams suggested that the diffused matter or Ether, which is the recipient of the heat radiations of the Universe, is thereby drawn into the depths of the solar mass; expelling thence the previously condensed and thermally exhausted Ether, it becomes compressed and gives up its heat, to be in turn itself driven out in a rarefied and cooled state, to absorb a fresh supply of heat, which he supposes to be in this way taken up by the Ether, and again concentrated and redistributed by the Suns of the Universe.

>In Volume II of the same work, the philosophical systems of the Gnostics and the primitive Jewish Christians, the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, are fully considered. They show the views held in those days, outside the circle of Mosaic Jews, about Jehovah. He was identified by all the Gnostics with the evil, rather than with the good principle. For them, he was Ilda‐Baoth, the “Son of Darkness,” whose mother, Sophia Achamôth, was the daughter of Sophia, the Divine Wisdom—the female Holy Ghost of the early Christians—Âkâsha; Sophia Achamôth personifying the Lower Astral Light or Ether. The Astral Light stands in the same relation to Âkâsha and Anima Mundi, as Satan stands to the Deity. They are one and the same thing seen from two aspects, the spiritual and the psychic—the super‐ethereal, or connecting link between matter and pure spirit—and the physical. Ilda‐Baoth—a compound name, made up of Ilda (ילד), child, and Baoth; the latter from בהוצ an egg, and בהות, chaos, emptiness, void, or desolation; or the Child born in the Egg of Chaos, like Brahmâ—or Jehovah, is simply one of the Elohim, the Seven Creative Spirits, and one of the lower Sephiroth. Ilda‐Baoth produces from himself seven other Gods, “Stellar Spirits,” or the Lunar Ancestors, for they are all the same. They are all in his own image, the “Spirits of the Face,” and the reflections one of the other, who become darker and more material, as they successively recede from their originator. They also inhabit seven regions disposed like a stair, for its steps mount and descend the scale of spirit and matter. With Pagans and Christians, with Hindûs and Chaldeans, with Greek as with Roman Catholics—the texts varying slightly in their interpretations—they all were the Genii of the seven planets, and of the seven planetary spheres of our septenary Chain, of which Earth is the lowest. This connects the “Stellar” and “Lunar” Spirits with the higher planetary Angels, and the Saptarshis, the Seven Rishis of the Stars, of the Hindûs—as subordinate Angels, or Messengers, to these Rishis, their emanations, on the descending scale. Such, in the opinion of the philosophical Gnostics, were the God and the Archangels now worshipped by the Christians! The “Fallen Angels” and the legend of the “War in Heaven” are thus purely pagan in their origin, and come from India, viá Persia and Chaldea. The only reference to them in the Christian canon is found in Revelation xii, as quoted a few pages back.

>Discussing and explaining the nature of the invisible Elements and the “Primordial Fire” mentioned above, Éliphas Lévi invariably calls it the “Astral Light”: with him it is the “Grand Agent Magique.” Undeniably it is so, but—only so far as Black Magic is concerned, and on the lowest planes of what we call Ether, the noumenon of which is Âkâsha; and even this would be held incorrect by orthodox Occultists. The “Astral Light” is simply the older “Sidereal Light” of Paracelsus; and to say that “everything which exists has been evolved from it, and it preserves and reproduces all forms,” as he does, is to enunciate truth only in the second proposition. The first is erroneous; for if all that exists was evolved through (or viâ) it, this is not the Astral Light, since the latter is not the container of all things but, at best, only the reflector of this all. Éliphas Lévi very truly shows it “a force in Nature,” by means of which “a single man who can master it ... might throw the world into confusion and transform its face”; for it is the “Great Arcanum of transcendent Magic.” Quoting the words of the great Western Kabalist in their translated form, we may, perhaps, the better explain them by the occasional addition of a word or two, to show the difference between Western and Eastern explanations of the same subject. The author says of the great Magic Agent:

>It is vacuity, no doubt, especially for Rationalists. At any rate Âkâsha is sure to produce vacuity in the brain of a Materialist. Nevertheless, though Âkâsha is certainly not the Ether of Science—not even the Ether of the Occultist who defines the latter as one of the principles of Âkâsha only—it is as certainly, together with its primary, the cause of sound, a psychical and spiritual, not a material cause by any means. The relations of Ether to Âkâsha may be defined by applying to both Âkâsha and Ether the words used of the God in the Vedas, “So himself was indeed (his own) son,” one being the progeny of the other and yet itself. This may be a difficult riddle to the profane, but very easy to understand for any Hindû—even though not a Mystic.

>It thus becomes evident that it is not this Ether—sprung at the fourth remove from an emanation of “Intelligence, associated with Ignorance”—which is the high Principle, the deific Entity worshipped by the Greeks and Latins under the name of “Pater, Omnipotens Æther,” and “Magnus Æther,” in its collective aggregate. The septenary gradation, and the innumerable sub‐divisions and differences, made by the Ancients between the powers of Ether collectively—from its outward fringe of effects, with which our Science is so familiar, up to the “Imponderable Substance,” once admitted as the “Ether of Space,” but now about to be rejected—have been ever a vexing riddle for every branch of knowledge. The Mythologists and Symbologists of our day, confused by this incomprehensible glorification on the one hand, and degradation on the other, of the same deified Entity and in the same religious systems, are often driven to the most ludicrous mistakes. The Church, firm as a rock in each and all of her early errors of interpretation, has made of Ether the abode of her Satanic legions. The whole Hierarchy of the “Fallen” Angels is there; Cosmocratores, the “World Bearers,” according to Bossuet; Mundi Tenentes, the “World Holders,” as Tertullian calls them; Mundi Domini, “World Dominations,” or rather Dominators; the Curbati, or “Curved,” etc.; thus making of the stars and celestial orbs in their courses—Devils!

>Spirit, then, or Cosmic Ideation, and Cosmic Substance—one of whose “principles” is Ether—are one, and include the Elements, in the sense St. Paul attaches to them. These Elements are the veiled Synthesis standing for Dhyân Chohans, Devas, Sephiroth, Amshaspends, Archangels, etc. The Ether of Science—the Ilus of Berosus, or the Protyle of Chemistry—constitutes, so to speak, the rude material, relatively, out of which the above‐named Builders, following the plan traced out for them eternally in the Divine Thought, fashion the Systems in the Kosmos. They are “myths,” we are told. No more so than Ether and the Atoms, we answer. The two latter are absolute necessities of Physical Science, and the Builders are as absolute a necessity of Metaphysics. We are twitted with the objection: You never saw them. And we ask the Materialists: Have you ever seen Ether, or your Atoms, or, again, your Force? Moreover, one of the greatest Western Evolutionists of our modern day, co‐“discoverer” with Darwin, Mr. A. R. Wallace, when discussing the inadequacy of Natural Selection alone accounting for the physical form of Man, admits the guiding action of “higher intelligences” as a “necessary part of the great laws which govern the material Universe.”

>Chaos was called senseless by the Ancients, because—Chaos and Space being synonymous—it represented and contained in itself all the Elements in their rudimentary, undifferentiated State. They made Æther, the fifth Element, the synthesis of the other four; for the Æther of the Greek philosophers was not its Dregs, although indeed they knew more than Science does now of these Dregs (Ether), which are rightly enough supposed to act as an agent for many Forces that manifest on Earth. Their Æther was the Âkâsha of the Hindûs; the Ether accepted in Physics is but one of its sub‐divisions, on our plane, the Astral Light of the Kabalists with all its evil as well as its good effects.

>Stallo then points out the change caused by the kinetic theories; that from the date of the dynamical theory of heat, Ether was chosen in Optics as a substratum for luminous undulations. Next, in order to explain the dispersion and polarization of light, Physicists had to resort once more to their “scientific imagination,” and forthwith endowed the Ether with (a) atomic or molecular structure, and (b) with an enormous elasticity, “so that its resistance to deformation far exceeded that of the most rigid elastic bodies.” This necessitated the theory of the essential discontinuity of Matter, hence of Ether. After having accepted this discontinuity, in order to account for dispersion and polarization, theoretical impossibilities were discovered with regard to such dispersion. Cauchy’s “scientific imagination” saw in Atoms “material points without extension,” and he proposed, in order to obviate the most formidable obstacles to the undulatory theory (namely, some well‐known mechanical theorems which stood in the way), to assume that the ethereal medium of propagation, instead of being continuous, should consist of particles separated by sensible distances. Fresnel rendered the same service to the phenomena of polarization. E. B. Hunt upset the theories of both. There are now men of Science who proclaim them “materially fallacious,” while others—the “atomo‐mechanicalists”—cling to them with desperate tenacity. The supposition of an atomic or molecular constitution of Ether is upset, moreover, by thermo‐dynamics, for Clerk Maxwell showed that such a medium would be simply gas. The hypothesis of “finite intervals” is thus proven of no avail as a supplement to the undulatory theory. Besides, eclipses fail to reveal any such variation of colour as is supposed by Cauchy, on the assumption that the chromatic rays are propagated with different velocities. Astronomy has pointed out more than one phenomenon absolutely at variance with this doctrine.

>This distribution of solid ponderable matter through ether extends, according to the theory before us, to everything that exists at this moment. The ether is all‐pervading. The human body itself is charged with the ether [Astral Light rather]; its minute particles are held together by it; the plant is in the same condition; the most solid earth, rock, adamant, crystal, metal, all are the same. But there are differences in the capacities of different kinds of ponderable matter to receive sun‐force, and upon this depends the various changing conditions of matter; the solid, the liquid, the gaseous condition. Solid bodies have attracted caloric in excess over fluid bodies, and hence their firm cohesion; when a portion of molten zinc is poured upon a plate of solid zinc, the molten zinc becomes as solid because there is a rush of caloric from the liquid to the solid, and in the equalization the particles, previously loose or liquid, are more closely brought together.... Metcalfe himself, dwelling on the above‐named phenomena, and accounting for them by the unity of principle of action, which has already been explained, sums up his argument in very clear terms, in a comment on the densities of various bodies. “Hardness and softness,” he says, “solidity and liquidity, are not essential conditions of bodies, but depend on the relative proportions of ethereal and ponderable matter of which they are composed. The most elastic gas may be reduced to the liquid form by the abstraction of caloric, and again converted into a firm solid, the particles of which would cling together with a force proportional to their augmented affinity for caloric. On the other hand, by adding a sufficient quantity of the same principle to the densest metals, their attraction for it is diminished when they are expanded into the gaseous state, and their cohesion is destroyed.”

>In the hieroglyphic work of Hermes, the Tarot, called also the book of Thoth, the duad is represented either by the horns of Isis, having her head veiled and an open book partially concealed under her mantle, or otherwise by a sovereign lady, Juno, the Greek goddess, having one hand uplifted towards heaven and the other pointed to earth, as if formulating by this gesture the one and twofold dogma which is the foundation of magic, and begins the marvellous symbols of the Emerald Table of Hermes. In the Apocalypse of St John there is a reference to two witnesses or martyrs on whom prophetic tradition confers the names of Elias and Enoch Elias, man of faith, enthusiasm, miracle ; Enoch one with him who is called Hermes by the Egyptians, honoured by the Phoenicians as Cadmus, author of the sacred alphabet, and the universal key to the initiations of the Logos, father of the Kabbalah, he who, according to the sacred allegories, did not die like other men, but was transported to heaven, to return at the end of time. Much the same statement is made of St John himself, who recovered and explained in his Apocalypse the symbolism of the word of Enoch. This resurrection of St John and Enoch, expected at the close of the ages of ignorance, will be the restitution of their doctrine by the comprehension of the Kabbalistic keys which unlock the temple of unity and universal philosophy, too long occult, and reserved solely for the elect, who perish at the hands of the world.

>We see from this rabbinical table, which John Belot and others borrowed from the Hebrew kabbalists, that these ancient masters concluded a posteriori from facts to presumable influences, which is completely within the logic of the occult sciences. We see also what diverse significations are included in the twenty-two keys which form the universal alphabet of the Tarot, together with the truth of our assertions, when we say that all secrets of the Kabbalah and magic, all mysteries of the elder world, all science of the patriarchs, all historical traditions of primeval times, are enclosed in this hieroglyphic book of Thoth, Enoch, or Cadmus.

>We see in the Bible that the high priests consulted the Lord on the golden table of the holy ark, between the cherubs, or bull-headed and eagle-winged sphinx ; that they consulted by the help of the Theraphim, Urim, and Thummi, and by the Ephod. Now, it is known that the Ephod was a magical square of twelve numbers and twelve words engraved on precious stones. The word TerapMm in Hebrew signifies hieroglyphs or figured signs ; the Urim and Thummi were the above and beneath, the east and west, the yes and no, and these signs corresponded to the two pillars of the Temple, JAKIN and BOHAS. When, therefore, the high priest wished to consult the oracle, he drew by lot the Theraphim or tablets of gold, which bore the images of the four sacred words, and placed them by threes round the rational or Ephod ; that is, between the two onyx stones which served as clasps to the little chains of the Ephod. The right onyx signified Gedulah, or mercy and magnificence ; the left referred to Geburah, and signified justice and anger. If, for example, the sign of the lion were found on the left side of the stone which bore the name of the tribe of Judah, the high priest would read the oracle thus : " The staff of the Lord is angered against Judah." If the Theraphim represented the man or cup, and were also found on the left, near the stone of Benjamin, the high priest would read : " The mercy of the Lord is weary of the offences of Benjamin, which violate Him in His love. Whence He will pour out on him the chalice of his wrath," etc. When the sovereign priesthood ceased in Israel, when all oracles were silenced in the presence of the Word made man, and speaking by the mouth of the most popular and mildest of sages, when the ark was lost, the sanctuary profaned, and the temple destroyed, the mysteries of the Ephod and Theraphim, no longer traced on gold and precious stones, were written, or, rather, drawn, by some learned kabbalists on ivory, parchment, gilt and silvered copper, and, finally, on simple cards, which were always suspected by the official Church as enclosing a dangerous key to its mysteries. Hence came those Tarots, the antiquity of which, revealed to the erudite Court de G-ebelin by the science of hieroglyphs and numbers, so exercised later the doubtful perspicacity and persistent investigation of Etteilla. Court de Gebelin, in the eighth volume of his "Primeval World," gives the figure of the twentytwo keys and four aces of the Tarot, and demonstrates their perfect analogy with all symbols of the highest antiquity. He subsequently endeavours to supply their explanation, and goes astray naturally, because he does not start from the universal and sacred tetragram, the Io EVOHE of the Bacchanalia, the JOB HE VAU HE of the sanctuary, the rnrr of the Kabbalah. Etteilla or Alliette, preoccupied entirely by his system of divination and the material profit to be derived from it, Alliette, formerly barber, having never learned French, or even orthography, pretended to reform and thus appropriate the Book of THCT. In the Tarot, now become very scarce, which he engraved, we find the following naive advertisement on the twenty-eighth card the eight of clubs : " Etteilla, professor of algebra and correctors (sic) of the modern blunders of the ancient book of Thot, lives in the Eue de 1'Oseille, No. 48, Paris." Etteilla would have certainly done better not to have corrected the blunders of which he speaks ; his books have degraded the ancient work discovered by Court de Gebelin into the domain of vulgar magic and fortune-telling by cards. He proves nothing who tries to prove too much ; Etteilla furnishes another example of this old logical axiom ; at the same time, his endeavours led him to a certain acquaintance with the Kabbalah, as may be seen in some rare passages of his unreadable works. The true initiates who were Etteilla's contemporaries, the Eosicrucians, for example, and the Martinists, who were in possession of the true Tarot, as a work of Saint Martin proves, where the divisions are those of the Tarot, and this passage of an enemy of the Eosicrucians : " They pretend to the possession of a volume from which they can learn anything that can possibly be found in other books which now exist or may at any time be produced. This volume is their reason, in which they find the prototype of everything that exists by the facility of analysing, making abstractions, forming a species of intellectual world, and creating all possible beings. See the philosophical, theosophical, microcosmic cards." (Conspiracy against the Catholic Religion and Sovereigns, by the author of The Veil raised for the Curious. Paris : Crapard. 1792.) The true initiates, we repeat, who held the Tarot secret among their greatest mysteries, carefully refrained from protesting against the errors of Etteilla, and left him to reveil instead of revealing the arcana of the true clavicles of Solomon. Hence it is not without profound astonishment that we have discovered intact and still unknown this key of all doctrines and all philosophies of the old world. I speak of it as a key, and such it truly is, having the circle of four decades as its ring, the scale of 22 characters for its trunk or body, and the three degrees of the triad for its wards ; as such it was represented by Postel in his " Key of Things Kept Secret from the Foundation of the World." He indicates after the following manner

>The basis of absolute hieroglyphical science was an alphabet in which deities were represented by letters, letters represented ideas, ideas were convertible into numbers, and numbers were perfect signs. This hieroglyphical alphabet was the great secret which Moses enshrined in his Kabalah; its Egyptian origin is commemorated in the _Sepher Yetzirah_, in which it is referred to Abraham. Now this alphabet is the famous Book of Thoth, and it was divined by Court de Gebelin that it has been preserved to our own day in the form of Tarot cards. It passed later on into the hands of Etteilla, who interpreted it in the wrong sense, for even a study extending over thirty years could not atone for his want of common sense or supply deficiencies in his education. The record exists still among the drift and waste of Egyptian monuments; and its most curious, most complete key is found in the great work on Egypt by Athanasius Kircher. It is the copy of an Isiac tablet which belonged to the celebrated Cardinal Bembo. The tablet in question is of copper with figures in enamel, and it has been unfortunately lost. The copy supplied by Kircher is, however, exact. The learned Jesuit divined that it contained the hieroglyphic key of sacred alphabets, though he was unable to develop the explanation. It is divided into three equal compartments; above are the twelve houses of heaven and below are the corresponding distributions of labour throughout the year, while in the middle place are twenty-one sacred signs answering to the letters of the alphabet. In the midst of all is a seated figure of the pantomorphic IYNX, emblem of universal being and corresponding as such to the Hebrew _Yod_, or to that unique letter from which all other letters were formed. The IYNX is encircled by the Ophite triad, answering to the Three Mother Letters of the Egyptian and Hebrew alphabets. On the right are the ibimorphic and serapian triads; on the left are those of Nepthys and Hecate, representing active and passive, fixed and volatile, fructifying fire and generating water. Each pair of triads in conjunction with the centre produces a septenary, and a septenary is contained in the centre. The three septenaries furnish the absolute number of the three worlds, as well as the complete number of primitive letters, to which a complementary sign is added, like zero to the nine numerals. The ten numbers and the twenty-two letters are termed in Kabalism the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom, and their philosophical description is the subject of that venerated primæval book known as the _Sepher Yetzirah_, the text of which will be found in the collection of Pistorius and elsewhere. The alphabet of Thoth is the original of our Tarot only in an indirect manner, seeing that the latter is of Jewish origin in the extant copies and that its pictures are not older than the reign of Charles VII. The cards of Jacquemin Gringonneur are the first Tarots of which we have any knowledge, but they reproduce symbols belonging to the highest antiquity. The game in its modern form was an experiment on the part of astrologers to restore the king, who has been mentioned, to reason. The oracles of the Tarot give answers as exact as mathematics and measured as the harmonies of Nature. Such answers result from the varied combination of the different signs. But it requires a considerable exercise of reason to make use of an instrument belonging to reason and to science; the poor king, in his childish condition, saw only the playthings of an infant in the artist’s pictures and he turned the mysterious Kabalistic alphabet into a game of cards.

>THE NETSAH THE septenary is the sacred number in all theogonies and in all symbols, because it is composed of the triad and the tetrad. The number seven represents magical power in all its fulness ; it is the mind reinforced by all elementary potencies ; it is the soul served by nature ; it is the sanctum regnum mentioned in the keys of Solomon, and represented in the Tarot by a crowned warrior, who bears a triangle on his cuirass, and is posed upon a cube, to which two sphinxes are harnessed, straining in opposite directions, while their heads are turned the same way. This warrior is armed with a fiery sword, and holds in his other hand, a sceptre surmounted by a triangle and a sphere. The cube is the philosophical stone ; the sphinxes are the two forces of the great agent, corresponding to Jakin and Bohas, the two pillars of the temple; the cuirass is the knowledge of divine things, which renders the wise man invulnerable to human assaults ; the sceptre is the magic rod ; the fiery sword is the symbol of victory over the deadly sins, seven in number, like the virtues, the conceptions of both being typified by the ancients under the figures of the seven planets then known. Thus, faith that aspiration towards the infinite, that noble self-reliance sustained by confidence in all virtues that faith, which, in weak natures, may degenerate into pride, was represented by the Sun ; hope, the enemy of avarice, by the Moon ; charity, in opposition to luxury, by Venus, the bright star of the morning and evening ; strength, superior to wrath, by Mars ; prudence, hostile to idleness, by Mercury; temperance, opposed to gluttony, by Saturn, who was given a stone instead of his children to devour ; finally, justice, in opposition to envy, by Jupiter, the conqueror of the Titans. Such are the symbols borrowed by astronomy from the Hellenic cultus. In the Kabbalah of the Hebrews, the Sun represents the angel of light ; the Moon, the angel of aspirations and dreams ; Mars, the destroying angel ; Mercury, the angel of progress ; Jupiter, the angel of power ; Saturn, the angel of the wilderness. They were named Michael, Gabriel, Samael, Anael, Raphael, Zachariel, and Orifiel.

>These governing potencies of souls shared human life in periods, which astrologers measured by the revolutions of the corresponding planets. But kabbalistic astrology must not be confounded with judicial astrology. We will explain this distinction. Infancy is dedicated to the Sun, childhood to the Moon, youth to Mars and Venus, manhood to Mercury, ripe age to Jupiter, and old age to Saturn. Now, humanity in general subsists under laws of development analogous to those of individual life. On this groundwork Trithemius establishes his prophetic key of the seven spirits, to which we shall subsequently refer ; by means thereof, observing the analogical proportions of successive events, it is possible to predict important future occurrences with certitude, and to fix beforehand, from age to age, the destinies of nations and the world. St John, depositary of the secret doctrine of Christ, has introduced it into the kabbalistic book of the Apocalypse, which he represents sealed with seven seals. We there find the seven genii of ancient mythologies, with the cups and swords of the Tarot. The doctrine concealed under these emblems is the pure Kabbalah, already lost by the Pharisees at the time of Christ's advent. The scenes which succeed one another in this wonderful prophetic epic are so many pantacles, the keys of which are the ternary, the quaternary, the septenary, and the duodenary. Its hieroglyphic figures are analogous to those of the book of Hermes or the Genesis of Enoch, to make use of a tentative title which expresses merely the personal opinion of the erudite William Postel.

>By the help of this purely dogmatic explanation we shall already understand the kabbalistic alphabet of the Tarot. Thus, Figure I., entitled the Buffoon, represents the active principle in the economy of divine and human autotelia. Figure II., vulgarly called Pope Joan, represents dogmatic unity based upon numbers, and is the personification of the Kabbalah or the Gnosis. Figure III. represents divine Spirituality under the emblem of a winged woman, holding in one hand the apocalyptic eagle, and in the other the world suspended from the end of her sceptre. The other emblems are equally clear, and can be explained as easily as the first. Turning now to the four suits, namely, Clubs, Cups, Swords, and Circles or Pantacles, commonly called Deniers all these are hieroglyphics of the tetragram. Thus, the Club is the Egyptian Phallus or Hebrew jod ; the Cup is the cteis or primitive he ; the Sword is the conjunction of both, or the lingam, represented in Hebrew preceding the captivity by vau ; while the Circle or Pantacle, image of the world, is the Tie final of the divine name. Now let us take a Tarot and combine all its emblems one by one into the Wheel or EOTA of William Postel ; let us group the four aces, the four twos, and so on, together ; we shall then have ten packs of cards giving the hieroglyphic interpretation of the triangle of divine names on the scale of the denary, as previously tabulated.

>In archaic writings preceding the Captivity, the Hebrew tau was cruciform, which further confirms our interpretation of the twelfth plate of the Kabbalistic Tarot. The cross, which produces four triangles, is also the sacred sign of the duodenary, and on this account it was called the Key of heaven by the Egyptians. So Etteilla, confused by his protracted researches for the conciliation of the analogical necessities of this symbol with his own personal opinion, in which he was influenced by the erudite Court de Gebelin, placed in the hand of his upright hanged man, by him interpreted as Prudence, a Hermetic caduceus, formed by two serpents and a Greek tau. Seeing that he understood the necessity for the tau or cross on the twelfth leaf of the book of Thoth, he should also have seen the multiple and magnificent meaning of the Hermetic hanged man, the Prometheus of science, the living man who makes contact with earth by his thought alone, whose firm ground is heaven, the free and immolated adept, the revealer menaced with death, the conjuration of Judaism against Christ, which seems to be an involuntary admission of the secret divinity of the Crucified, lastly, the sign of the work accomplished, the cycle terminated, the intermediary tau, which resumes for the first time, before the final denary, the signs of the sacred alphabet.

>an an en decisions, and to refute them the same labour must be undertaken from an opposite standpoint. Paracelsus was perhaps the last of the great practical astrologers ; he cured diseases by talismans formed under astral influences ; he distinguished upon all bodies the mark of their dominant star ; there, according to him, was the true universal medicine, the absolute science of nature, lost by man's own fault, and recovered only by a small number of initiates. To recognise the sign of each star upon men, animals, and plants, is the true natural science of Solomon, that science which is said to be lost, but the principles of which are preserved notwithstanding, as are all other secrets, in the symbolism of the Kabbalah. It will be readily understood that in order to read the stars one must know the stars themselves ; now, this knowledge is obtained by the kabbalistic domification of the sky and by the understanding of the celestial planisphere, recovered and explained by Gaffarel. In this planisphere the constellations form Hebrew letters, and the mythological figures may be replaced by the symbols of the Tarot. To this same planisphere Gaffarel refers the origin of patriarchal writing, and in the chains of starry attraction the first lineaments of primitive characters may very well have been found, in which case the celestial book would have served as the model of Henoch's, and the kabbalistic alphabet would have been the synopsis of the entire sky. This is not wanting in poetry, nor, above all, in probability, and the study of the Tarot, which is evidently the primitive

>Such is the great and sublime revelation of the magi, a revelation which is the mother of all symbols, of all dogmas, of all religions. We can realise already how far Dupuis was mistaken in regarding astronomy as the source of every cultus. It is astronomy, on the contrary, which has sprung from astrology, and primitive astrology is one of the branches of the holy Kabbalah, the science of sciences, and the religion of religions. Hence upon the seventeenth page of the Tarot we find an admirable allegory a naked woman, typifying Truth, Nature, and Wisdom at one and the same time, turns two ewers towards the earth, and pours out fire and water upon it ; above her head glitters the septenary, starred about an eight-pointed star, that of Venus, symbol of peace and love ; the plants of earth are flourishing around the woman, and on one of them the butterfly of Psyche has alighted ; this emblem of the soul is replaced in some copies of the sacred book by a bird, which is a more Egyptian and probably a more ancient symbol. In the modern Tarot the plate is entitled the Glittering Star ; it is analogous to a number of Hermetic symbols, and is also in correspondence with the Blazing Star of Masonic initiates, which expresses most of the mysteries of Eosicrucian secret doctrine.

>Metallic transmutation takes place spiritually and materially by the positive key of analogies. Occult medicine is simply the exercise of the will applied to the very source of life, to that astral light the existence of which is a fact, which has a movement conformed to calculations having the great magical arcanum for their ascending and descending scale. This universal arcanum, the final and eternal secret of transcendent initiation, is represented in the Tarot by a naked girl, who touches the earth only by one foot, has a magnetic rod in each hand, and seems to be running in a crown held up by an angel, an eagle, a bull, and a lion. Fundamentally, the figure is analogous to the cherub of Jekeskiel, of which a representation is here given, and to the Indian symbol of Addhanari, which again is analogous to the ado-nai of Jekeskiel, who is vulgarly called Ezekiel. The comprehension of this figure is the key of all the occult sciences. Readers of my book must already understand it philosophically if they are at all familiar with the symbolism of the Kabbalah. It remains for us now to realise what is the second and more important operation of the great work. It is something undoubtedly to find the philosophical stone, but how is it to be ground into the powder of projection ? What are the uses of the magical rod ? What is the real power of the divine names in the Kabbalah ? The initiates know, and those who are deserving of initiation will know in turn if they discover the great arcanum by means of the very numerous and precise indications which we have given them. Why are these simple and pure truths for ever and of necessity concealed ? Because the elect of the understanding are always few on earth, and are encompassed by the foolish and wicked like Daniel in the den of lions. Moreover, analogy instructs us in the laws of the hierarchy, and absolute science, being an omnipotence, must be the exclusive possession of the most worthy. The confusion of the hierarchy is the actual destruction of societies, for then the blind become leaders of the blind, according to the word of the Master. Give back initiation to priests and kings and order will come forth anew. So, in my appeal to the most worthy, and in exposing myself to all the dangers and anathemas which threaten revealers, I believe myself to have done a great and useful thing, directing the breath of God living in humanity upon the social chaos, and creating priests and kings for the world to come.

This signifies, according to the version of Fabre d'Olivet : " Now, original attraction (cupidity) was the entraining passion of all elementary life (the interior active power) of nature, the work of Jhoah, the Being of beings." But herein Fabre d'Olivet is beside the true interpretation, because he was unacquainted with the grand keys of the Kabbalah. The word Nahasch, explained by the symbolical letters of the Tarot rigorously signifies :

>These hieroglyphical combinations of letters and numbers belong to the practical part of the kabbalah, which, from this point of view, is divided into Gematriah and Temurah. Such calculations, which now seem to us arbitrary or devoid of interest, then belonged to the philosophical symbolism of the East, and were of the highest importance in the teaching of holy things emanating from the occult sciences. The absolute kabbalistic alphabet, which connected primitive ideas with allegories, allegories with letters, and letters with numbers, was then called the keys of Solomon. We have already stated that these keys, preserved to our own day, but wholly misconstrued, are nothing else than the game of Tarot, the antique allegories of which were remarked and appreciated for the first time in the modern world by the learned archaeologist, Court de Gebelin.

>The creation of gold in the great work takes place by transmutation and multiplication. Raymund Lully states that in order to make gold we must have gold and mercury, while in order to make silver we must have silver and mercury. Then he adds : " By mercury, I understand that mineral spirit which is so refined and purified that it gilds. the seed of gold, and silvers the seed of silver." Doubtless, he is here speaking of Od, or astral light. Salt and sulphur are serviceable in the work only for the preparation of mercury ; it is with mercury above all that the magnetic agent must be assimilated and incorporated. Paracelsus, Kaymund Lully, and Nicholas Flamel seem alone to have perfectly understood this mystery. Basil Valentine and Trevisan indicate it after an incomplete manner, which might be capable of another interpretation. But quite the most curious things which we have found on this subject are indicated by the mystical figures and magical legends in a book of Henry Khunrath, entitled Amphitheatrum Sapientice jflternce. Khunrath represents and resumes the most learned Gnostic schools, and connects in symbology with the mysticism of Synesius. He affects Christianity in expressions and in signs, but it is easy to see that his Christ is the Abraxas, the luminous pentagram radiating on the astronomical cross, the incarnation in humanity of the sovereign sun celebrated by the Emperor Julian ; it is the luminous and living manifestation of that Ruach-Elohim which, according to Moses, brooded and worked upon the bosom of the waters at the birth of the world ; it is the man-sun, the monarch of light, the supreme magus, the master and conqueror of the serpent, and in the four-fold legend of the evangelists, Khunrath finds the allegorical key of the great work. One of the pantacles of his magical book represents the philosophical stone erected in the middle of a fortress surrounded by a wall in which there are twenty impracticable gates. One alone conducts to the sanctuary of the great work. Above the stone there is a triangle placed upon a winged dragon, and on the stone is graven name of Christ qualified as the symbolical image of all iture. " It is by him alone," he adds, " that thou canst )btain the universal medicine for men, animals, vegetables, id minerals." The winged dragon, ruled by the triangle, ipresents, therefore, the Christ of Khunrath ; that is, the >vereign intelligence of light and life ; it is the secret of pentagram ; it is the highest dogmatic and practical lystery of traditional magic. Thence unto the grand and rer incommunicable maxim there is only one step. The kabbalistic figures of Abraham the Jew, which imparted to Flamel the first desire for knowledge, are no other than the twenty-two keys of the Tarot, elsewhere initiated and resumed in the twelve keys of Basil Valentine. There the sun and moon reappear under the figures of emperor and empress ; Mercury is the juggler ; the Great Hierophant is the adept or abstractor of the quintessence ; death, judgment, love, the dragon or devil, the hermit or lame elder, and, finally, all the remaining symbols are there found with their chief attributes, and almost in the same order. It could have scarcely been otherwise, since the Tarot is the primeval book and the keystone of the occult sciences ; it must be Hermetic, because it is kabbalistic, magical, and theosophical. So, also, we find in the combination of its twelfth and twenty-second keys, superposed one upon the other, the hieroglyphic revelation of the solution of the grand work and its mysteries. The twelfth key represents a man hanging by one foot from a gibbet composed of three trees or posts, forming the Hebrew letter fl ; the man's arms constitute a triangle with his head, and his entire hieroglyphical shape is that of a reversed triangle surmounted by a cross, an alchemical symbol known to all adepts, and representing the accomplishment of the great work. The twenty-second key, which bears the number twenty-one, because the fool which precedes it carries no numeral, represents a youthful female divinity slightly veiled and running in a flowering circle, supported at four corners by the four beasts of the Kabbalah. In the Italian Tarot this divinity has a rod in either hand ; in the Besanson Tarot, the two wands are in one hand while the other is placed upon her thigh, both equally remarkable symbols of magnetic action, either alternate in its polarisation, or simultaneous by opposition and transmission.

>Of all oracles, the Tarot is the most astounding in its answers, because all possible combinations of this universal key of the kabbalah give oracles of science and of truth for their solutions. The Tarot was the sole book of the ancient magi ; it is the primitive Bible, as we shall prove in the following chapter, and the ancients consulted it as the first Christians at a later date consulted the Sacred Lots, that is, Bible verses selected by chance and determined by thinking of a number. Mile. Lenormand, the most celebrated of our modern fortune-tellers, was unacquainted with the science of the Tarot, or knew it only by derivation from Etteilla, whose explanations are shadows cast upon a background of light. She knew neither high magic nor the kabbalah, but her head was filled with ill-digested erudition, and she was intuitive by an instinct which deceived her rarely. The works she left behind her are Legitimist tomfoolery, ornamented with classical quotations, but her oracles inspired by the presence and magnetism of those who consulted her, were often astounding. She was a woman in whom extravagance of imagination and mental rambling were substituted for the natural affections of her sex ; she lived and died a virgin, like the ancient druidesses of the isle of Sayne. Had nature endowed her with beauty, she might have easily at a remoter epoch played the part of a Melusine or a Velleda.

>One of the greatest magi of the Christian era, Trithemius, irreproachable abbot of a Benedictine monastery, learned theologian, and master of Cornelius Agrippa, has left among his unappreciated and inestimable works, a treatise entitled, De septem secundeis, id est intelligentiis sive spiritibus orbes post Deum moventibus. It is a key of all prophecies new or old, a mathematical, historical, and simple method of surpassing Isaiah and Jeremiah in the prevision of all great events to come. The author in bold outline sketches the philosophy of history, and divides the existence of the entire world between the seven genii of the kabbalah. It is the grandest and widest interpretation ever made of those seven angels of the Apocalypse who appear successively with trumpets and cups to pour out the word and its realisation upon the earth. The duration of each angelic reign is 354 years and four months, beginning with that of Orifiel, the angel of Saturn, on the 13th of March, for, according to Trithemius, this was the date of the world's creation; it was a period of savagery and darkness. Next came the reign of Anael, the spirit of Venus, on the 24th of June, in the year of the world 354, when love began to be the instructor of mankind ; it created the family, and the family led to association and the primitive city. The first civilisers were poets inspired by love; presently the exaltation of poetry produced religion, fanaticism, and debauchery, culminating subsequently in the deluge. This state of things continued till the 25th of October, being the eighth month of the year A.M. 708, when the reign of Zachariel, the angel of Jupiter, was inaugurated, under whose guidance men began to acquire knowledge, and dispute the possession of lands and dwellings. It was also the epoch of the foundation of towns and the limitation of empires ; its consequences were civilisation and war. The need for commerce began, furthermore, to be felt, at which time namely, the 24th of February, A.M. 1063 was inaugurated the reign of Eaphael, angel of Mercury, angel of science and of the word, of intelligence and industry. Then letters were invented, the first language being hieroglyphic and universal, a monument of which has been preserved in the book of Enoch, Cadmus, Thoth, and Palamedes ; the kabbalistic clavicle adopted later on by Solomon, the mystical book of the Theraphim, Urim, and Thumrnim, the primeval Genesis of the Zohar, and of William Postel, the mystical wheel of Ezekiel, the rota of the Kabbalists, the Tarot of the Magi and the Bohemians. Then were arts invented, and navigation was attempted for the first time; relations extended, wants multiplied, and there followed speedily an epoch of general corruption, preceding the universal deluge, under the reign of Samael, angel of Mars, which was inaugurated on the 26th of June, A.M. 1417. After long stupefaction, the world strove towards a new birth under Gabriel, the angel of the moon, whose reign began on the 28th of March, A.M. 1771, when the family of Noah became multiplied, and re-peopled the whole earth, after the confusion of Babel, until the reign of Michael, angel of the sun, which commenced on the 24th of February, A.M. 2126, to which epoch must be referred the

>The word may read EOTA, thus signifying the wheel of Ezekiel, or TAROT, and then it is synonymous with the AZOTH of Hermetic philosophers. It is a word which kabbalistically expresses the dogmatic and natural absolute ; it is formed of the characters of the monogram of Christ, according to the Greeks and Hebrews. The Latin K or Greek P is found between the alpha and omega of the Apocalypse ; the sacred Tau, image of the cross, encloses the whole word, as previously represented in our Ritual. Without the Tarot, the magic of the ancients is a closed book, and it is impossible to penetrate any of the great mysteries of the Kabbalah. The Tarot alone interprets the magic squares of Agrippa and Paracelsus, as we may satisfy ourselves by forming these same squares with the keys of the Tarot, and reading off the hieroglyphs thus collected. These are the seven magical squares of the planetary genii according to Paracelsus :

>It will be observed that this alphabet has only twentytwo letters, the V and N being duplicated, and that it is arranged in four quinaries, with a quaternary for base and key. The four final letters are two combinations of the duad and the triad, and, read kabbalistically, they form the word AZOTH, by rendering to the shapes of the letters their value in primitive Hebrew, taking N for N, Z as it is in Latin, V for the Hebrew 1 vau, which is pronounced O between two vowels, or letters having the value of vowels, and X for the primitive tau, which had precisely the same figure. The entire Tarot is thus explained in this wonderful medal, which is worthy of Paracelsus, and we hold it at the disposal of the curious. The letters arranged by four times five are summed by the word mZ, analogous to that of mrp, and of INEI, and containing all the mysteries of the Kabbalah.

>It was at the epoch of the Gnostic and Manichaean heresies that the Tarot must have been lost to the Church, at which time also the meaning of the divine Apocalypse perished. It was understood no longer that the seven seals of this kabbalistic book are seven pantacles, the representation of which we give (see p. 376), and that these pantacles are explained by the analogies of the numbers, characters, and figures of the Tarot. Thus the universal tradition of the one religion was a moment broken, darkness or doubt spread over the whole earth, and it seemed, in the eyes of ignorance, that true Catholicism, the universal revelation, had briefly disappeared. The explanation of the book of St John by the characters of the Kabbalah will be an entirely new revelation, though foreseen by several distinguished magi, one among whom, M. Augustin Chaho, thus expresses himself : " The poem of the Apocalypse presupposes in the young evangelist a complete system and traditions individually developed by himself. It is written in the form of a vision, and binds in a brilliant framework of poetry the whole erudition, the whole thought of African civilisation. An inspired bard, the author touches upon a series of ruling events ; he draws in bold outlines the history of society from cataclysm to cataclysm, and even further still. The truths which he reveals are prophecies brought from far and wide, of which he is the resounding echo. He is the voice which cries, the voice which chants the harmonies of the desert, and prepares the paths for the light. His speech peals forth with mastery and compels faith, for he carries among savage nations the oracles of lao, and unveils Him who is the First-Born of the Sun for the admiration of civilisations to come. The theory of the four ages is found in the Apocalypse, as it is found in the books of Zoroaster and in the Bible. The gradual reconstruction of primeval federations, and of the reign of God among peoples emancipated from the yoke of tyrants and the bonds of error, are clearly foretold for the end of the fourth age, and the renovation of the cataclysm, exhibited at first from afar, even unto the consummation of time. The description of the cataclysm and its duration ; the new world emerging from the waves, and spreading in all its beauty under heaven ; the great serpent, bound for a time by an angel in the depths of the abyss ; finally, the dawn of that age to come, prophesied by the Word, who appeared to the apostle at the beginning of his poem : ' His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire ; and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven

>Accordingly, I now proceed with the evidence. In 1820, numerous experiments were performed by me in Paris, at the Hotel-Dieu, and many incredulous physicians, attracted by the novelty, witnessed them, and wished to satisfy themselves that there was no deception. To this I assented, and accordingly they proceeded to prove the insensibility of the patients by a variety of tests, many of which were very cruel ; but these experiments were not performed by me ; it was a sort of sacrifice of humanity which incredulity insisted upon, and in the infancy of the science I had no alternative excepting to permit them, or allow truth itself to be compromised by the refusal. Hence the unconscious patients were subjected to the following trials : — their lips and nostrils were tickled with feathers ; their skin was pinched until ecchymoses (bruises) were produced ; smoke was introduced into the nasal passages, and the feet of one female were plunged into a strong infusion of mustard-seed at a high temperature. But not the slightest sign of pain did they evince. The expression of the countenance remained unchanged, nor was the pulse in any degree affected. On being awakened, however, out of the magnetic sleep, they all experienced the pain usually attendant on such applications, and were exceedingly angry at the treatment they had received. Many of the physicians who had witnessed this scene, and who were convinced of the reality of the magnetic influence, applied to me to teach them how to conduct the operation, and several very soon acquired the method, upon which they proceeded to convince themselves, by their own personal experiments, of the absolute extinction of sensibility in such cases. The means they adopted were on many occasions revolting, but the result removed every shade of doubt from their minds. I now, therefore, proceed to adduce their evidence. It is no longer I who attest the facts ; and praise or blame, should either be bestowed, will be alike inapplicable to me. Here, therefore, I subjoin the following proces-verbal by Dr. Kobouam, who was then attached to the Hotel-Dieu. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 6th of January, 1821, M. Recamier, on visiting the hospital, requested me to put into magnetic sleep a man named Starin, whose bed was No. 8 of the ward Sainte-Madelaine. M. Recamier first threatened him with the application of moxa,* if he allowed himself to fall asleep, and I caused the patient, much against his will, to pass into the magnetic sleep, during which M. Recamier applied the moxa on the fore-part of the right thigh, which moxa produced an eschar seventeen lines in length and eleven in breadth ; that Starin did not manifest the least sign of pain, either by crying out, gesture, or variation of the pulse ; that he did not feel the application of the moxa until I had roused him out of the magnetic sleep. Madame SainteMonique, the matron of the ward, MM. Gibert, La Peyre, Bergeret, Carquet, Truche, &c, &c, were present during this seance" Here, also, is another procesverbal by the same physician. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 8th of January, 1821, at the request of M. Recamier, I put into magnetic sleep the woman Leroy (Lise), lying in the bed No. 22 in the ward Sainte-Agnes. M. Recamier had previously threatened that he would apply a moxa to her person if she allowed herself to fall asleep. I, Robouam, then, much against her will, caused the patient to fall into magnetic sleep, during which M. Gibert burned agaric under her nostrils, and this nauseous smell produced no perceptible effect ; that afterwards M. Recamier himself applied moxa on the epigastric region (pit of the stomach), which produced an eschar of fifteen lines in length and nine in breadth ; that during the operation, the patient did not shew the least symptoms of suffering, either by cries, gestures, or variation of the pulse ; that she remained in a state of perfect insensibility, and that on awakening from the magnetic sleep, she shewed signs of suffering great pain. MM. Gibert, Crequi, &c, were present at this seance? (Signed,) Robouam, Docteur-Medecin.

>The penetrating intensity and subtile power of the magnetic influence is best illustrated by the magnetiser performing the operation at a distance, and without the knowledge of the patient, through the intervention of such opaque bodies as a screen, folding doors, or thick walls. The possibility of the operation being conducted efficiently in this manner is established beyond a doubt ; and I proceed, therefore, to cite some few facts in proof of it, because, before entering on the explication of the phenomena of animal magnetism, it is necessary that all the facts should be distinctly detailed. On the 4th of November, 1820, the Commissioners having assembled at the Hotel Dieu, M. Husson, one of the physicians of the hospital, said to me, " You can induce sleep in a very short time ; I wish you would obtain the same result without the patient either seeing you or being aware of your presence." I replied that I was willing to try, but that did not warrant the success of the experiment, because the action at a distance depended so much on the peculiar susceptibility of the individual. We agreed, however, upon a signal which I could hear in an adjoining apartment. M. Husson was to throw a pair of scissars down upon the table, and I was then to begin the operation. Accordingly I was ushered into a closet, separated from the room by a thick partition ; and the door having a good lock and key, I felt no hesitation in locking myself in, as I wished to multiply obstacles, so that no pretext might be left for suspicion or doubt. The patient was then brought into the adjacent room, and seated at a distance of about three or four feet, with her back turned towards the closet wherein I was concealed. They then, to deceive her, began wondering why I had not yet arrived, and Ihey pretended from this delay to conjecture that I did not intend to come; at the same time, they blamed me for not keeping my appointment. In short, my alleged absence was adverted to in such a manner as to leave no doubt, on the mind of the patient, that I was really elsewhere. The signal being then given, although I knew not where nor at what distance Mile. Samson was placed, I began to magnetise in the most profound silence, carefully avoiding the least movement which might apprise her of my being present. It was then thirty-five minutes past nine. In the course of three minutes, as soon as my will began to act, she was observed to rub her eyes, exhibit the usual symptoms of approaching sleep, and at length fell into a state of somnambulism. This experiment I repeated on the 7th of November, before Professor Recamier, who took every precaution to prevent deception, and the result was precisely similar. The following are the details of this second trial : — On my entering, at a quarter past nine, the operating room, M. Husson informed me that M. Recamier wished to be present, and to see me put the patient to sleep through the partition. I readily acquiesced. M. Recamier then entered, and privately conversed with me on the subject, when we agreed upon a signal ; and I slipped into the closet, where I was again locked in. Mile. Samson was then brought in ; M. Recamier placed her with her back turned towards the closet, at a distance of more than six feet from it. He then proceeded to converse with her, and found her better ; but on being told that I was not likely to arrive, she insisted upon retiring. The moment M. Recamier asked her whether she digested meat, which was the signal agreed upon between us, I began to magnetise her at thirty-two minutes past nine. Three minutes after, M. Recamier touched her, raised her eyelids, shook her by the hands, put questions to her, pinched her, and convinced himself that she was in a state of profound magnetic sleep. But even these trials were thought insufficient to establish so extraordinary a phenomenon ; and it was resolved, therefore, to multiply them, and vary all their details. Accordingly, I went one night, accompanied by M. Husson and other physicians, to the ward in which the same patient was, and took my position from her at a distance of several beds, keeping at the same time the most profound silence, so as not to attract attention. I began magnetising her at eight minutes past seven. At twelve minutes past, we all drew near, and convinced ourselves that magnetic sleep had been induced. It is unnecessary to add, that the period fixed on for this operation had been selected, not by me, but by the principal physician of the hospital ; further, that it had been ascertained that the patient was not asleep before the experiment, and that the magnetic influence had been exerted at a distance of about twenty feet. Having witnessed these experiments, M. Bertrand, Doctor of Medicine of the University of Paris, affirmed that he did not think it extraordinary that the patient should fall asleep while the magnetiser was in the closet ; because the constant recurrence of the same attending circumstances might have, independently of my presence, produced the same results ; and that, moreover, the patient might be naturally predisposed to sleep. He therefore proposed that she should be brought into the same room, and seated on the same seat, and that a conversation should be held with her as before. This repetition of the same circumstances, he thought, would induce sleep. But he was deceived. At a quarter before ten, they began to execute the plan agreed upon ; — she was seated on the same easy chair where she usually sat, and placed in the same position. Various questions were put to her ; she was then left to her own thoughts ; the signals previously used were again repeated, — scissars were thrown upon the table ; they went, in fact, through a complete rehearsal of everything previously done, but in vain was the magnetic state expected. She complained, became restless, shifted her position, and evinced anything but a disposition to either natural or magnetic sleep. After this, on my entering the room and. commencing the operation, the magnetic sleep, accompanied by the usual state of physical insensibility was perfectly established.

>Of the instances already given of the production of Mesmeric phenomena, some are quite incompatible with the notion that they are excited by impressions made upon the mind, through the common avenues of sensation. The following, on the one hand, help to put that alternative supposition quite aside, and on the other, determines some of the conditions necessary for the operation of the Mesmeric influence When Dr. Elliotson's little patients are in a state of Mesmeric somnambulism, if you place your hand near their hands or feet, and move your fingers, the fingers of the hands, or feet of the patients, likewise begin to move.* If, then, or after having simply held your hand near the hand or foot of one of the somnambulists, you draw your hand slowly away, the hand or foot of the patient follows your hand. After the hand or foot has followed your hand a short distance, the patient drops from the state of somnambulism into the state of coma, — that is to say, the effect thus produced is twofold. The influence of your hand is first to drag the hand or foot of the somnambulist after it; secondly (like every other movement directed at the somnambulist), to determine coma. And these results ensue equally, whether you are before the patient and seen by her, or at her side, or out of the sphere of vision, or behind her, a thick wooden screen being interposed A pasteboard screen being interposed between Dr. Elliotson and the little somnambulist, when he advanced his hand, with one finger lifted, towards her, she became mute and dull, but did not fall ; when .he repeated the experiment with a dose of three fingers, she fell at once. This must necessarily appear ridiculous, unless you saw it, and saw it repeatedly succeed, as I have. There is, however, some seeming caprice in all these results ; sometimes it happens that, no sensible cause having interfered, for many minutes no Mesmeric phenomena can be produced ; sometimes the cause may be traced. When, for instance, the little somnambulists are much interested in anything going on before them, the efforts of the magnetiser are temporarily baffled. The Mesmeric influence shown in the production of coma may be conveyed from one person in the state of somnambulism to another. — The three little patients, in the state of Mesmeric waking, were seated in three chairs, holding each others hands. A sheet of pasteboard was then interposed between the first and second. The first was then thrown into the state of coma ; the other two immediately fell into the same. On trying then to wake the first to the state of somnambulism, the ordinary means failed ; the influence of the coma of the two others beat the means employed to wake the first. On separating her hand from that of the second, she was awakened at once by the common means. — The Mesmeric influence will not travel through a person not in the state of somnambulism — from one Mesmeric somnambulist to another. Dr. Elliotson sat down in the place of the middle one of the three engaged in the last experiment, holding a hand of each of the others. On throwing one of the latter into coma, the other was unaffected, and remained, as before, in the state of somnambulism. — The Mesmeric influence, shewn in the production of muscular movements, may be conveyed from one person in the state of somnambulism to another. The three little patients being disposed as in the last instance but one, and a pasteboard screen being interposed between the first and second, on exciting motions in the unengaged hand of the first by the proximity of the hand of the operator, similar motions took place in the unengaged hand of the third, and some motion in the clasped hands of the second and the question — Cui bono the limited Mesmerism which you admit ? Some one on a similar occasion made the same inquiry of Franklin, who replied to the question of the minute philosopher, by asking another

>The Mesmeric trance may exist in two degrees, one analogous to sleep, the other analogous to somnambulism. Dr. Elliotson, on the occasions to which I advert, exhibited three patients, girls, of ages between thirteen and seventeen, who displayed in succession these two states, alternating with each other, or with the rational waking state, at the pleasure of the operator. These two states may be called Mesmeric coma, and Mesmeric sleeping-walking. — Mesmeric coma is a state of profound insensibility, in which the pulse is slightly quickened, the breathing gentle and natural, the pupil as ordinarily, but turned up or rolling away when the eyelids are opened, contracting on exposure to light. The insensibility is so profound as not to be disturbed by a strong electric shock, or by the sustained action of a magneto-galvanic battery, each so intense as to be intolerable to most persons. It should be mentioned that the muscles were convulsed under the influence of the galvanic discharge, while it appeared to be unfelt by the patient. The lesser stimuli of pinching or pricking the skin, or pulling the hair, produce no effect whatever. It is not to be doubted that any surgical operation might be performed upon a person in this state without her feeling it. — In Mesmeric sleep-walking, the patient is to a certain degree awake to external objects, and is able to support herself, and to walk about, but with hesitation and insecurity : she sees, but the eyes remain fixed for distant vision, so that objects close at hand appear double : she hears, but has no perception of the direction of sound, so that she does not turn her head to one addressing her standing by her side ; if the voice is a familiar one, she recognises it, and is anxious to know where the person is, and looks in search of the person, but looks straight before her only. The insensibility to touch is as great as in the Mesmeric coma : neither pinching the skin, nor pulling the hair, nor touching the surface of the eye, nor the electric or galvanic shock, provoke sensation any more than in the former state. Whether the muscular sense, and taste, and smell, are suspended, is not yet ascertained. Dr. Elliotson inclines to think that the former is preserved ; Mr. Wheatstone is of opinion that, together with taste and smell, the muscular sense is temporarily extinguished. Citric acid, and soda, which Mr. Wheatstone placed on the tongue successively, seemed to excite no sensation. Snuff does not produce sneezing. But one of these little patients, having two different weights placed in her hands, lifted more readily, and said that it was easier to lift the lighter than the heavier. The extent to which reflection and volition are awake in this state, appears to differ in different individuals. Two of the three young patients talk fluently, with great readiness of apprehension and reply, and some humour, in the state of somnambulism ; the other, who is younger, and when awake, of a more quiet and gentle disposition, hardly answers more than yes or no. The difference probably has to do with two causes : one, natural character, the other, the passing or permanent tendency to ordinary somnambulism and fits of delirium. One of the three patients shewn by Dr. Elliotson, after being thrown into the Mesmeric coma, spontaneously and suddenly awakes into the state of somnambulism, with an appearance of pleasure and delight at her returned consciousness, and instantly begins addressing observations to persons or objects around her. One of the two others requires to be artificially, and by a peculiar manipulation, aroused from the state of coma into that of somnambulism. The period in which one or both of the others would remain in the state of coma seems to be indefinite. Dr. Elliotson mentioned that one had been kept in this state twenty hours. With the state denoted by the term " Mesmeric coma" I know no spontaneous disorder of the system that has been proved to be identical ; but it is highlyprobable that in some other trances, and in some hysteric fits, insensibility as profound exists " When the state of coma supervenes, the iris contracts, as it does when one drops asleep ; but the contraction is transient, and goes away suddenly. It may be seen coming on for three or four seconds, while the coma is supervening ; the moment that is complete, the pupil becomes natural again, and maintains the same degree of contraction or dilatation as under the same light in the waking state. From the state of coma, it has been mentioned that one, if not two, of Dr. Elliotson's patients, spontaneously, in about a minute, wakes into the Mesmeric somnambulism. In the others, or in one of them certainly, this change does not take place spontaneously. To produce it a manipulation is used, which is equally effective with all three. If with both thumbs the eyebrows are once or twice strongly rubbed from the nose outwards, the little patient opens her eyes, and is at once in the state of somnambulism above described, and can hear and speak. A similar manipulation used on the forehead, or the cheek, or the chin, is totally useless, and the patient is left in the same state of coma as before. The same manipulation continued longer, restores the patient to perfect waking and the natural condition of the mind and body. When she is in the state of somnambulism, the least motion directed towards the patient by any spectator, not only when near, but when several feet off, instantly produces the state of coma. This effect takes place with more certainty if the motion is in front of the patient. Not only on moving the hand downwards, but on bowing, or on raising the foot before the patient, with a direction towards her, she drops into total unconsciousness. The coma is produced with equal certainty if a thick screen of board is interposed between the operator and the patient, as if he is standing immediately before and seen by her ; but the effect does not then ensue as soon as otherwise. One mode of inducing the state of coma upon somnambulism is to blow upon the patient's eyelids. What makes this effect the more singular is, that when the patient has thus been rendered comatose, blowing upon the eyelids awakens her into somnambulism ; so the patient's sleep-walking senses may be blown out, and afterwards blown in again.

>In the " Journal de Toulouse," April 5, 1830, the following case is reported : — " We have already witnessed the curious experiments performed at Toulouse, by the Comte de Brivazac ; the document which has now reached us, gives an account of a case which occurred in the department of the Gers, at the house of the justice of peace for the canton of Condom, in the presence of several persons, among whom were some of our own acquaintance. Jean Bordere, in the before-mentioned canton, was suffering from an abscess from congestion on the fore part of the thigh. His medical attendants declared that it was necessary to lance it freely, but that the operation should be conducted with much skill and prudence, because the crural artery ran through the tumour, which was very much enlarged. The Comte de Brivazac, whose power as a magnetiser is remarkable, proposed to throw the patient into a magnetic sleep, whereby insensibility might be superinduced, in order that the pain of the operation, inevitable in a waking state, might be spared the sufferer. His proposition was accepted. At the end of two minutes the patient was thrown into the magnetic state. His lucidity was not remarkable. He answered the magnetiser that it was in vain for him to try, as he could not perceive his complaint. At that moment, Dr. Larieu began, with great dexterity, the operation. He repeatedly plunged the probe into the opening made by the bistoury, in order to let out the purulent matter, the flow of which was occasionally impeded by albuminous flakes. A dressing was immediately afterwards ; applied. During the operation, the patient remained motionless as a statue ; his magnetic sleep was in nowise disturbed, and on the proposal being mooted that he should be brought out of the magnetic "state, M. de Brivazac spontaneously awakened him. M. Roc then drawing near, asked him whether he would submit to the operation, to which he replied, " I suppose I must, since it is necessary." M. Roc then informed him that it was unnecessary to recommence, as the operation had already been performed. The astonishment of the patient was at its height, when he saw the proofs of it ; for he had seen nothing, felt nothing, and remembered nothing, excepting the act of M. de Brivazac laying the palm of his hand upon his forehead to induce sleep."

>It has been said, however, that this mode of perception cannot exactly be called seeing, inasmuch as when such somnambulists are closely examined how it is that they perceive the relations of external objects, they all agree in answering that it is by a kind of inward feeling which they are unable to explain. A somnambulist of Fischer assured him that he saw his internal organs, not as with the eyes, but he could not describe the manner in which he perceived them. A patient of Hufeland's said, " I see" when she was in the highest degree of lucidity only, at other times she generally used the expression " I feel," this or that part, or this or that change, &c. A patient of Gmelin's said she did not see, but feel, and with great delicacy, both internally and externally. In the magnetic sleep, Scherb's patient also declared that her sensations were rather those of feeling than of sight, and that this peculiar feeling during that state was much more acute and delicate than when awake. A cataleptic patient of Despine's said to those who were en rapport with her, " You think that I do not know what passes around me, but you are mistaken ; I see nothing, yet I feel something which makes an impression upon me, but which I cannot explain."* These are curious facts. How far the sense of feeling may, under a peculiar state of exaltation, take cognizance of the outward forms and conditions of material objects remains yet to be determined ; certain it is, that in well-authenticated cases, both of natural and magnetic somnambulism, individuals, through some other channel than the eye itself, perceive, discriminate, and perform a variety of actions which could not be accomplished without vision being in some way or other engaged. In the animal economy it is a physiological law that one organ shall assume a preternatural activity in order to supply the function of another whose structure may be deranged ; thus it is clearly proved that the liver acts vicariously with the lungs ; the skin with the kidneys. It is the office of the lungs to throw out of the system, during expiration, carbonaceous matter ; and when, therefore, this organ is diseased, the liver assumes, in a manner, its function, and throws off the surplus carbon with the biliary secretion. Hence the frequency of diseases of the liver in those persons who have resided in tropical countries, where, owing to the climate, the lungs may have become affected. In like manner the vessels of the skin, acting vicariously with those of the kidneys, throw off the watery parts of the blood when the secretion of this organ has, from any cause, been obstructed. Here there is an unquestionable transference of function between the grosser organs of organic life — and why should not the higher organs of sense, under certain abnormal conditions, act on a similar principle, vicariously with each other ? It is well known that persons who unhappily are blind and deaf acquire a preternaturally acute sense of touch, so that they are able to discriminate by feeling, properties of bodies which could not be so appreciated by other persons. This, however, is only a very subordinate physical manifestation of that law of derivation to which I here allude ; it may, nevertheless, be the initiatory condition of that transference of the senses which is in the magnetic state much more perfected.

>In the usual magnetic sleep, there sometimes occurs a peculiar state, seldom observed, and much dreaded by magnetisers, because very few among them possess the means of bringing it to a favourable issue. I will endeavour to describe it. A person plunged in the magnetic sleep (and it generally occurs in those individuals whose sleep is most profound) collapses into an extraordinary state, of which the following are the chief symptoms : — The somnambulist who heard his magnetiser perfectly, is suddenly seized with a fit of deafness ; he neither hears nor feels him any longer ; and the magnetiser discovers that he has entirely lost all control over him ; he no longer obeys his injunctions ; he is as dumb to him as to every body else ; his jaws are firmly fixed together, and it would be easier to break than sunder them ; he is motionless, yields to the laws of gravitation, and his body appears powerfully attracted to the ground. The pulse at the wrist diminishes its beats in number and intensity ; the temperature of the body perceptibly lowers, and inevitable death appears to be impending. If the magnetiser be familiar with this phenomenon, and do not abandon the patient, he will gradually recover from this state of concentration ; the pulse will resume its usual cadence, and, returning into the ordinary state of somnambulism, he will, on being questioned, state that he has had certain visions during his lethargic state ; but, by a strange anomaly, although still in the somnambulic state, he can hardly recal them, or even describe the sensations he experienced.

>First: The magnetic state was proved to be a further development and extension of the motive powers of organic life; and it was shown that the propelling forces that control one system in sensation, life, health, and enjoyment, could be united to another system, and both become as one — that, according to the laws which govern animal existences of a positive nature with reference to their negatives, the magnetic state could be produced by a transferation of the forces of the two.

>But to return. It was the Marquis de Puysegur, who first induced, or rather, observed particularly, that peculiar state of being which, in contradistinction to natural, is termed magnetic somnambulism. He had been a pupil of Mesmer, and having retired to his estate at Busancy, near Soissons, practically adopted the instructions of his preceptor, and treated magnetically the sick persons who applied to him. He was a man universally esteemed for his integrity and philanthropy ; he was also a powerful and efficient magnetiser, and the cures which he wrought were so marked, and so numerous, that the peasantry thronged from all parts of the neighbouring country to consult him. On one of these occasions, he discovered the psychical phenomena referred to ; and so marvellous did they appear, even to him, that in transmitting his memoir to the secretary of the Harmonic Society, at Strasburg, he could not refrain from observing, " The time is not yet ripe for the publication of the facts I have witnessed ; they are difficult to believe, notwithstanding the mass of evidence which attests them ; I therefore beg you will not lend this memoir to any one, for I confide my account of these cases to you only, in order that they may assist you in your reflections, and facilitate you in the means of curing, even more successfully than I have done, during your magnetic trials." It appears, that while magnetising his gardener, he observed him fall into a deep and tranquil sleep ; and it then occurred to him, that he would address some questions to him, as he might have done to a natural somnambulist. He did so ; and the man immediately answered him with much intelligence and clearness, upon which he persevered in the magnetic operation, and soon found that he possessed an extraordinary psychical influence over him ; that all further manual movements were unnecessary ; and that without speaking he could mentally communicate with, and control, his ideas. " It is from this simple man," says he, " this tall and stout rustic, twenty-three years of age, enfeebled by disease, or rather, by sorrow, and, therefore, the more pre-disposed to be affected by any great natural agent, — it is from this man, I repeat, that I derive instruction and knowledge. He is no longer, when in the magnetic state, a peasant, who can hardly utter a single sentence, — he is a being, to describe whom I cannot find a name. I need not speak, I have only to think before him, when he instantly hears, and answers me. Should anybody come into the room, he sees him, if I desire it, and addresses him, and says what I wish him to say ; not, indeed, exactly as I dictate to him, but as truth requires. When he wants to add more than I deem it prudent strangers should hear, I stop the flow of his ideas, and of his conversation, in the middle of a word, and give his thoughts quite a different turn." He then adds : " I know of no subject more profound, more lucid, than this peasant in his crisis. I have several patients approaching his state of lucidity, but none equal him."

>A host of additional facts of the same description are in my possession, but the evidence already brought forward will be considered conclusive to every impartial mind. Not only does the magnetic somnambulist enjoy, in this state of clairvoyance, a lucidity respecting surrounding objects and passing events, but it extends still further, inasmuch as they foresee, and distinctly foretell, the day, the hour, even the minute, when certain events will happen. This is termed the faculty of prevision, and occurs only in the very highest degree of magnetic exaltation. It may appear incredible ; but let us look to the facts. In the treatise on somnambulism by Dr. Bertrand, we find that this physician witnessed upwards of sixty convulsive fits of the most aggravated nature, which it was absolutely impossible the patient could have simulated, all of which, and their duration to a minute, had been foretold during the magnetic sleep. The same physician assures us that a somnambulist told him a fortnight previously, that she should be seized with a delirium which would last forty-three hours, which happened according to her prediction ; and he further satisfied himself that this somnambule when awake had not the slightest recollection of what she had said in her sleep. This prevision was also noticed by Drs. Rostan and Georget, one of whom observes : — " I have seen, positively seen, and repeatedly, somnambulists foretell, several hours or days — even twenty days in advance, the precise hour and minute of the accession of epileptic or hysterical fits, and describe what would be their duration and intensity, which came to pass in exact accordance with the prediction." I have myself witnessed innumerable instances of this faculty of prevision being developed during the magnetic somnambulism, but, as my authority would doubtless be impugned as ex parte evidence, I prefer again appealing to the report of the French Academicians, the validity of whose testimony cannot reasonably be challenged.

>" Artificial or magnetic somnambulism," says he, " is the result of certain processes, consisting in gestures, manipulations, and acts of volition, operating on persons susceptible of exhibiting its phenomena ; it is, as it were, inoculated by the magnetiser. The natural state of the patient submitted to his action when susceptible of receiving it, is generally separated from the subsequent magnetic state by a somnolence of a few minutes. In the crisis a great number of faculties lie dormant, which has caused animal magnetism to retain the name of somnambulism, although magnetism may sometimes be induced without sleep.

>Lastly. On recovering from their somnambulism, they remember nothing which occurred during the magnetic state ; but when again thrown into somnambulism, the memory between the two magnetic states is continuous.

>" The somnambulic state requires the greatest caution. Man in the magnetic state is to be considered as the most interesting being in existence. With regard to his magnetiser, it is through his unbounded confidence in you that you have been enabled to bring him completely under vour control. It is, therefore, for no other purpose but that of benefiting him, that you have any right to exert your power. Attempting to deceive him, or abuse his confidence, while in this state, is to commit a dishonest action, having a tendency contrary to his benefit ; whence it follows that a contrary result is produced to that originally contemplated. The patient must not be annoyed with questions ; he must be allowed to take cognizance of his new state. As it is by an act of your will that you put him to sleep, so it is by an act of your will that you can awaken him. It may happen sometimes that the patient will experience trembling, or slightly convulsive motions ; in that case, you must immediately stop your first operation, and give all your attention to the alleviation of his sufferings. There are various degrees of somnambulism. Sometimes nothing but a simple somnolency can be obtained from one patient ; in another, the effect of magnetism is to close his eyelids so that he cannot open them of his own accord ; he then hears everybody, and is not completely in the magnetic state. This intermediate state is very common. These effects are not so beneficial as complete somnambulism, for the magnetiser cannot learn anything from the patient ; but they are as favourable to health. Some precautions are to be taken with a patient passing into somnambulism. As soon as you perceive that the patient has closed his eyes, and otherwise manifested some sensibility to the magnetic emanation, you must not at first tease him with questions, and, least of all, endeavour to make him do anything requiring muscular exertion. The state in which he is plunged is new to him : you must let him, as it were, take cognizance of it. The first question should be, 6 How do you find yourself?' and then, 6 Do you feel any benefit from what I am doing ?' You may then express the pleasure you feel by giving him relief. Hence you gradually come to the details of his malady, and the subject of your first questions should never go beyond the state of his health. You ought not to act in opposition to the desire of your somnambulist ; you should consult him about the time when he wishes to be magnetised and drawn out of his crisis, likewise respecting the medicaments he requires ; and always follow his advice with the utmost punctuality. However remote a somnambulist's prescription may be from the general notions previously adopted in medicine, his own sensation is a safer guide than all the data resulting from observation. He is, as it were, the interpreter of nature ; he follows the dictates of a lucid instinct ; not to obey them in every particular would be missing the aim we have in view, — namely, his restoration to health." M. de Puyscgur concludes his instructions by reminding his pupils that " man, being ever actuated by the consideration of his own interest, seldom performs a good action without at the same time serving his own private ends. In other words, it is only by discovering in himself a spiritual principle of a higher order, emanating directly from the Creator of the universe, that he can feel the necessity of gratifying the desires of his soul, who, like her own divine Original, can delight in nothing but that which is in harmony with goodness and truth. This intimate conviction increases to a considerable degree the magnetiser's power."

>All hold nearly the same language, and suggest the idea of the soul being partially disencumbered of the coils of its mortality — seeing, hearing, feeling, taking cognizance of all things past, present, and future, through some other channels than the physical organs of its subordinate manifestations. All, too, agree in enjoying, in this state, a sort of exquisite elysium of repose from which they dread to be disturbed ; the soul, apparently half set free, shrinks from being again brought back and entangled in the chains which bind it down to the narrow sphere of suffering humanity. It is impossible to contemplate a somnambulist in this state without a feeling of awe, not unmixed with anxious wonder ; he is a being who appears to belong more to the world that is to come, than to that in which, as finite beings, we exist ; he already appears half disrobed of his carnal nature, and participating in the sense, if not the actual. enjoyment, of his immortality : it is impossible to divine what views of infinity may now open before him ; all we observe is, a being like ourselves exalted into a state of temporary beatifaction, far above our sympathy, and beyond our comprehension. They invariably beseech us not to awaken them or bring them back to their ordinary condition ; but the magnetiser should be cautious how he listens to their entreaties, and should, rather than otherwise, hasten to draw them out of this state ; for he should remember that he is exhausting his own energies, and the moment may arrive when it might be necessary for further exertion, and he be unable to command it. He should regard himself as being the mere organ, as it were, secreting or throwing out, under the energy of his volition, the magnetic fluid ; and in proportion as he becomes fatigued, and the secretion itself exhausted, his influence over the patient, whether in the magnetic state or not, must diminish or altogether cease. On this account it is that magnetisers often fail to induce the effects they anticipate ; they exert themselves to the utmost ; the patient exhibits all the premonitory signs of the magnetic state, but a step is yet wanting — the step itself is not established —because the operator cannot command the requisite magnetic power. It is, indeed, wonderful how few men can command any high degree of sustained mental energy ; the faculties of the mind, like the limbs of the human body, require exercise in order that they may attain their full development ; but so much are they neglected that the finest susceptibilities of our nature are often not called into action, and may be literally said to go down with us into the grave unborn.

>" Paul was then magnetised, and soon placed in a state of somnambulism. He recapitulated what related to his treatment, and prescribed that, on that same day, a sinapism should be applied to each of his legs for an hour and a half ; that next day he should take a bath of Bareges ; and that, upon coming out of the bath, sinapisms should be again applied during twelve hours without interruption, sometimes to one place, and sometimes to another ; that, upon the following day, after having taken a second bath of Bareges, blood should be drawn from his right arm to the extent of a palette and a half. Finally, he added, that by following this treatment he would be enabled, upon the 28th, i. e., three days afterwards, to walk without crutches on leaving the sitting, at which, he said, it would still be necessary to magnetise him. The treatment which he had prescribed was followed ; and upon the day named, the 28th of September, the committee repaired to the Hopital de la Charite. Paul came, supported on his crutches, into the consulting-room, where he was magnetised, as usual, and placed in a state of somnambulism. In this state, he assured us that he should return to bed without the use of his crutches, without support. Upon awaking, he asked for his crutches ; we told him that he had no longer any need of them. In fact, he rose, supported himself on the paralysed leg, passed through the crowd who followed him, descended the step of the chambre d' experiences, crossed the second court of the building, ascended two steps, and when he arrived at the bottom of the stair he sat down. After resting two minutes, he ascended, with the assistance of an arm and the balustrade, the twenty-four steps of the stair which led to the room where he slept, went to bed without support, sat down again for a moment, and then took another walk in the room, to the great astonishment of all the other patients, who, until then, had seen him constantly confined to bed. From this day Paul never resumed his crutches."

>In addition to these theories, which do not carry with them even a colouring of plausibility, many lay considerable stress on the effects which the monotonous manipulations of the magnetiser must have on the patient. It is true that monotonous actions and sounds, — a rocking cradle, a swing, an old lullaby, the murmurs of the sea, — anything which by constant repetition fatigues the attention, will induce sleep; but let it be observed, that the sleep which is so produced is a perfectly natural sleep, there is neither insensibility, somniloquism, clairvoyance, or any of the phenomena which characterise the magnetic state. No monotonous motions of the hands merely before any person will give rise to these effects ; they depend, as I have already explained, on the will of the magnetiser, and the monotonous movements of the hands may, in many cases, be altogether dispensed with ; they are not necessarily a part of the operation. Lastly ; a theory has been lately proposed by Dr. Sigmond, who, having operated successfully in many cases, is of opinion that the " art consists in obliging the individual again to inspire by the nostrils the carbon he has already expired, whilst the currents of air caused by the extended fingers produce some effect on the facial nerves."* It is true enough, as travellers amuse themselves by proving at the Grotto del Cane that the inspiration of carbonic oxide gas induces stupor ; but Dr. Sigmond will, I doubt not, be able himself to draw a diagnosis between the stupor arising from the inhalation of narcotic gases and the insensibility of the magnetic state ; besides, it may reasonably be doubted whether the passing the fingers up and down before the nostrils, or even wrapping the mouth round with a cotton comforter, which might occasion a person to inhale repeatedly the breath he had expired, would lead to the accumulation of a sufficient quantity of this gas in the lungs to produce even stupor : this again is an untenable hypothesis. Hence not one of these theories affords any satisfactory explication of the magnetical phenomena which are developed.

>As is usually the case with Highlanders, they are a strong race of people, and most of them reach a considerable age unacquainted with disease. Maladies common to Lowlanders, as the ague, are here unknown ; but nervous derangements frequently appear in early youth, — a thing scarcely to have been expected amongst so robust a people. Thus it is observed, in a place called Neuhiitte, situated, like Prevorst, upon the mountains, that a sort of St. Yitus's dance becomes epidemic, chiefly amongst young people, so that all the children of the place are seized with it at the same time. Like persons in a magnetic state, they are aware of the precise moment that a fit will seize them ; and i? they are in the fields when the paroxysm is approaching, they hasten home^ and immediately fall into a convulsion, in which condition they will move, for an hour or more, with the most surprising regularity, keeping measure like an accomplished dancer ; after which they frequently awake as out of a magnetic sleep, without any recollection of what has happened. It is also certain, that these ijiountaineers are peculiarly sensible to magnetic influences, amongst the evidences of which are their susceptibility to sympathetic remedies, and their power of discovering springs by means of the divining rod.

>The above allegory is at the root of the Occult law, which prescribes silence upon the knowledge of certain secret and invisible things, perceptible only to the spiritual mind (the sixth sense), and which cannot be expressed by “noisy” or uttered speech. This chapter of Anugîtâ explains, says Arjuna Mishra, Prânâyâma, or regulation of the breath in Yoga practices. This mode, however, without the previous acquisition of, or at least full understanding of, the two higher senses (of which there are seven, as will be shown), pertains rather to the lower Yoga. The Hatha so called was and still is discountenanced by the Arhats. It is injurious to the health, and alone can never develop into Râja Yoga. This story is quoted to show how inseparably connected in the metaphysics of old, are intelligent beings, or rather “intelligences,” with every sense or function, whether physical or mental. The Occult claim that there are seven senses in man, and in nature, as there are seven states of consciousness, is corroborated in the same work, Chapter vii, on Pratyâhâra (the restraint and regulation of the senses, Prânâyâma being that of the “vital winds” or breath). The Brâhmana, speaking of the institution of the seven sacrificial Priests (Hotris), says: “The nose and the eye, and the tongue, and the skin and the ear as the fifth [or smell, sight, taste, touch, and hearing], mind and understanding are the seven sacrificial priests separately stationed,” which “dwelling in a minute space (still) do not perceive each other,” on this sensuous plane, none of them except mind. For mind says: “The nose smells not without me, the eye does not take in colour, etc., etc. I am the eternal chief among all elements [i.e., senses]. Without me, the senses never shine, like an empty dwelling, or like fires the flames of which are extinct. Without me, all beings, like fuel half dried and half moist, fail to apprehend qualities or objects even with the senses exerting themselves.”

>The Elements, whether simple or compound, could not have remained the same since the commencement of the evolution of our Chain. Everything in the Universe progresses steadily in the Great Cycle, while incessantly going up and down in the smaller Cycles. Nature is never stationary during Manvantara, as it is ever becoming, not simply being; and mineral, vegetable, and human life are always adapting their organisms to the then reigning Elements; and therefore those Elements were then fitted for them, as they are now for the life of present humanity. It will only be in the next, or Fifth, Round that the fifth Element, Ether—the gross body of Âkâsha, if it can be called even that—will, by becoming a familiar fact of Nature to all men, as Air is familiar to us now, cease to be, as at present, hypothetical and an “agent” for so many things. And only during that Round will those higher senses, the growth and development of which Âkâsha subserves, be susceptible of a complete expansion. As already indicated, a partial familiarity with the characteristic of matter—Permeability—which should be developed concurrently with the sixth sense, may be expected to develop at the proper period in this Round. But with the next Element added to our resources, in the next Round, Permeability will become so manifest a characteristic of matter, that the densest forms of this Round will seem to man’s perceptions as obstructive to him as a thick fog, and no more.

>76. I ask again for M. Swedenborg. He appears. — -" You will have the goodness to answer a few questions as to the spiritual world, now that you inhabit it; your answers would carry greater weight with them in your present state." — M. Renard attended at this sittina:. We ask M. Swedenborg- if he has nothing to rectify in the writings he left on earth, treating of the spiritual world 1 He answers, that they contain a few errors of little importance. He says that he is not satisfied ■ with some of his disciples, who do not conduct themselves as they ought. M. Swedenborg promises to return to us when we stand in need of him. Adele says : " He lays his hands on us as if to give us his blessing, and goes away." — We consulted together, M. Renard and I, as to what we ought to think of the apparition of this great ecstatico-prophet. Was it really he ? We had not the least doubt of it ; but we might be imposed upon by an evil spirit ; in that case, said we, God, whom we will call to our aid, and M. Swedenborg, will not suffer us to be deceived thus. Moreover, we shall discover him sooner or later, and know what value to set on his revelations ; but I ought to observe, that if an evil spirit has the powder of presenting himself in the place of a good one, he may be driven away by a command, in the name of God. Such a course has invariably succeeded with me and it is what I do at each apparition. Once the person summoned is seen, we should demand of him a token of recognition, which he displays to you, whether by a particular sign, a jewel, or aught else, God never suffering evil spirits to counterfeit in this respect. Neither should we suppose, because an evil spirit may happen to commit a few mistakes in his revelations, especially in his earthly reminiscences, mistakes to which they are very liable, that it is an evil spirit that deceives us. No : we must expect miscalculations. Spirits can not answer all that is asked tJiem, because their knowledge is confined to their peculiar affection. Thus, we should seek spirits that participate in ours, if we desire to obtain correct solutions ; but it seldom happens, however, that relations or friends are replaced by malicious spirits. 77. I summon M. Swedenborg, who forthwith presents himself. I order him, in the name of God, to withdraw if he is a false spirit ; on the contrary, he advances, takes Adele by the hand, and says to her: "Fear naught, I am indeed Swedenborg." — " Could you be replaced by an evil spirit "?" " No ; so long as you desire my presence, with the pure intention of instructing yourself, I will come ; but if on the contrary, you act with contempt and authority, I should not present myself, and another would come, in order to deceive you." — " Can you communicate with me by thought, through the medium of my clairvoyante ?" " No ; your thought is too deeply buried in matter. I could do so ; but it is best to avail ourselves of this young lady in order to avoid mistakes." — " Could you inform me of a means whereby I could enter into the state necessary to communicate directly with you, by the aid of certain narcotic combinations ?" " The only practicable means is magnetism; any other state, provoked by narcotics, irritates the nerves, influences the ideas by disorganizing them, and can not, consequently, be so good as the magnetic state." — " I ask you this, because I should wish to be enabled to express to you questions myself to prevent the possibility of their being altered 1" " In that case, I advise you to get powerfully magnetized behind your ears; it is your sensitive part, and probably you will succeed." — " Can you answer this question. Did God create man male and female, as the Bible says ?" *' The Bible is an excellent book, containing very good things for study. God did create a man and a woman." — " Do you mean thereby that every man whom God has created, has a woman equally created for him ]" "Yes, every being has his complement; woman and man are created in pairs." — " These two beings, are they born and do they die at the same time ]" " Time stands for naught in the matter ; they meet again in heaven when God wills it.'*' — " These two beings, are they in every respect similar in thought and form?" "Yes." — "In theii^ intimate union are they acquainted with love in its carnal acts as on earth ?" " Heavenly love can not be described by material language, it is an inexplicable sensation." — "Are single persons seen in heaven?" " Yes, but no being can be perfectly happy without being reunited to its half, which is its complement of life." — " Can they be separated by a caprice depending, or not depending, on them ?" " No, we can not be separated from what constitutes our happiness." — " Can the happiness of souls at rest be influenced in heaven by evil spirits?" "No; they are separate, and an inferior spirit can in nowise trouble the superior spirit." — " Have you the conviction that we return not to a second material existence 1" " We are in heaven for eternity." — " Can we count the time we pass in this state of happiness and the spaces we travel over V " Time is not reckoned there ; a thousand years are as one day in eternity ; space presenting no difficulty to its being cleared is not measured there. The body is so light that it finds itself conveyed wherever it desires without perceiving the distance over which it has travelled." — " Independent of the affections, are there any states through which we must pass to arrive at this superior degree of felicity ?" " The affection constitutes the states. The latter succeed each other according to the strength of the affection which engenders them, and leads them to the height of happiness."

>20. After a moment's concentration, Bruno perceives coming toward him an angel, in celestial costume — transparent robe, wavy hair, feminine physiognomy, legs bare, feet in buskined sandals ; this angel carries oif Bruno, who tells me he is leaving his body and going away ; at the lapse of an instant, he says : " I have traversed clouds ; my angel conducted me to my father, and left me alone with him." — " "What was your father doing?" "He is still reading." — "Is he happy]" ♦* Yes." — '* Does he eat, drink, and sleep ?" " He eats, drinks, and sleeps, only when disposed to do so for pleasure's sake, and not through necessity ; if he has a mind for a pear or any other fruit, he gathers it and eats it ; but I repeat, it is not through necessity, for spirits have no wants of this kind in heaven." — " What are their usages and occupations ?" " The same as on eai-th, what best pleases them." — " What are their acquirements V " Such as they are pleased to have, they study and learn by themselves what they desire to know." — " Can your father be deceived?" "No." — "Can he answer me a few questions V " Yes." — " Was it a good spirit that came at the last sitting ?" " No, I suspected him ; but they are all so very malicious, and wrap themselves up in so much precaution that one has some difficulty in recognising them." — " What now tells you that it is really your father who speaks to you 1 Can an evil spirit assume his form ?" " Yes : but my father will make himself known by placing his hand on his breast, a sign that an evil spirit can not take, because God permits only the good to make use of these kinds of signs : — an angel, for instance, will be recognised by a star, a crescent, a diamond, or precious stone. Were it not for this we should never distinguish between a good and an evil spirit."

>70. M. Mallet is more or less time before appearing. He invariably gives Adele his blessing at his coming: and o-oino-: it seems, from what the abbe tells us, that such was a practice with him on earth. I shall pass over the abbe's questions, which have no reference whatever to what I desire to know about the spiritual world. — " What do you think of possessions, particularly the Loudun ones?" "They are merely the malicious tricks of evil spirits, because the good spirits do naught but good." — "What do you think of the convulsionnaires of Saint-Medard, &c. V " Among them are found both good and very wicked actions; things incredible appertaining to good and to evil spirits, deeds ordained by God, others which are condemned by him. We even appreciate all those things only by a judgment enlightened by the Divine light, and disengaged from all haughty and egotistical calculation. I can answer all you ask me only by counselling you to be circumspect, and to pray to God to enlighten your intelligence." — " Do you think that we can render ourselves invi.sible to several persons at once 1" " Yes, by drugs and pacts with evil spirits; but there is naught so displeasing to God as those things by which we may do all possible harm." — " Could you tell me this secret, I believe myself incapable of abusing it ?" " You are incapable of it, at this moment, because you do not possess it ; but no sooner should you know it than the pride of having such power at your command would take possession of you and lead you to do evil, as the rest. God suffers not the good spirits to divulge those things." — ** Fascination plays the principal part in it, does it not ?" " Did you send for me merely to read you a course of magic 1" — " No ; but in order to know what to think of those mysteries ; so many things have been written on this subject that T should wish to be enabled to form an opinion respecting them." *' Do not trouble yourself about them. There are many good things written ; but there are also many falsehoods, and wicked doctrines. Say no more about them."

>99. M. Lucas, the person interested at the foregoing sitting, returned a few days after to ask me if I had heard anything new respecting his brother-in-law. I had not paid any attention to the matter. The mother of the lost man accompanied M. Lucas, and asked me if I could give her a sitting. I made a slight objeclion, because I was hoMing a conference with several persons ; but, on the observation of M. Lucas, who told me that this lady had come several leagues expressly to obtain fresh information, and that the coach was waiting for her, I begged the persons present to excuse me, and judge of the experiment about to take place. Adele, once asleep, said, " I see him." — " Where do you see him ?" " Here, present." — *' Give us once more a description of him, as also of the place where he is." " He is a fair man, browned by the heat of the sun ; very corpulent, features pretty regular, hazel eyes, mouth large, air sombre and meditative. He is in the garb of a working man — a sort of small blouse ; as at the last time, he is at work, gathering seeds like enough to peppercorns, but I don't think they are, as they seem bigger. This seed is found in small shrubs ab jut three feet hicrh. I see a nesrro near, who is doing the same thing." — " Try and obtain an answer to-day ; let him tell you the name of the country where you see him." "He won't answer me." — " Tell him that it is his good mother whom he was so fond of, who is with you, and bids you inquire after him." " Oh ! at the name of his mother he turned round and said to me, ' My mother ! I shall not die before seeing her again; comfort her, and tell her that I am always thinking of her; I a.m not dead!'" — "Why does he not write to herl" *' He has written to her, but no doubt the vessel was wrecked ; at least he presumes so, as he received no answer. He tells me that he is at Mexico : he followed the emperor, Don Pedro ; was five years a prisoner, sufiered much, and will make every effort to return to Fiance ; they will see him again." — " Can he name the place he lives in ?" " No, it is far up in the country ; such places have no names." — " Is he with a European ?'* " No, with a man of color." — " Why does he not write to his mother 1" *' Because where he is no vessels come; he knows not to whom to apply ; then, again, he scarcely ever knew how to write, and now less than ever ; no one near him can render him this service, no one speaks his language ; he has much pains in making himself understood ; withal, he never was of an open or communicative disposition ; he has a somewhat unsociable look. It is a hard malter to get a word out of him; one would thirdc he was dumb." — " In short, how manage to write to him or hear from him ?" " He can't tell ; all he can say is, ' I am in Mexico, I am not dead, they'll see me again.' " — " Why did he thus forsake his parents without saying a word to them, since he was happy with them 1" " This man was far from being communicative ; he scarcely ever spoke, was very fond of his mother, but had not the same affection for his father, who was a stern, sour kind of man, and often used him roughly. The cup had long been filled up to the brim ; it was not the slight altercation he had with his father, the night before his departure, that induced him to leave : it was a plan decided on long before; he communicated it to no one, and started off stealthily. Having embraced them all over night, he sneaked off the next morning, without saying a word. Make yourself easy, madam, you will see him again." The good woman melted into tears as she recognised the truthfulness of each detail given her by Adele ; she had not a word to retrench from this description ; the character, the instruction, and the departure of her son, were precisely such as Adele described ; but what gives an air of greater probability to the clairvoyante's recital as to the country he lives in, is, that some of his relatives entertained the idea that he had enlisted into Don Pedro's army, and took steps at that time to acquire a certainty of it. M. Lucas furnished me with this particular some time after wlien on a visit to Paris : no information, however, could be obtained in this respect. What no less contributed to astonish this good woman, as well as M. Lucas and the person present at this curious sitting, was to see Adele, who, to screen herself from the burning rays of the sun of these countries, put her hand up to the left side of her face as if suffocating with heat ; but the most marvellous part of the scene was that she received a violent coup-de-soleil, that rendered all this side of her face, from the forehead to the shoulder, of a reddish blue, while the other side remained perfectly white ; and full twentyfour hours elapsed before this deep color commenced disappearing. The heat was so violent there for a moment, that it was impossible to keep one's hand on it. Present at this sitting was M. Haranger Pirlot, formerly a magnetizer, and honorably known for more than thirty years in the magnetic world. He told me that he never saw the like of this. The good woman took her leave quite consoled, unable to account to herself how that her son, who was in Mexico, could be between her and Adele, and how the latter could have received a coup-de-soleil when nobody felt the heat, the weather that day being very gloomy. I am not more advanced than she, and believe that many others in our place will be like us. We submit this question to the learned ; awaiting their answer, let us pass on to another sitting.

>137. Madame Vedeaux, for fifteen years a student of magnetism, finding herself momentarily at Paris, desires to avail herself of this opportunity of paying a visit to several clairvoyant subjects. She took a sitting at a young person's, whose clairvoyance she had been previously enabled to judge of. To a question put by this lady, the clairvoyante replied : *' I know but one somnambulist in Paris who can give you a solution to the question you ask : go to No. 17 Rue Tiquetonne ; you will find there a subject surrounded by angels and departed spirits that direct her, so that she is much more elevated than I am." Acting upon this advice, the lady came and asked me for a distant-view sitting. I did not promise her a clairvoyance of the first order, such views not being Adele's speciality, and not having for the moment any subject at my disposition. Agreeably to the wishes of my fair visiter, I begged Adele to look over this lady's property, and tell us whether there was any hidden treasure there. She replied thus : *' I see some water, apparently, to me, in a cistern ; it is dark ; then a turret, not unlike a dove-cot. It is contiguous to a house that stands by itself, and surrounded with fields. There is a room on the ground-floor with two windows ; on the first floor there is a room which also has two windows. This house is three stories high ; the main building has two wings, with which there is a communication by the staircases and corridors where the turret stands; it is quite a small room, in which I see a spirit wandering : it is a person who was murdered there a verylong time ago." Adele shrinks back in affright : I quiet her and she says that she is dragged toward a small store-room on the ground-floor, in which she can scarcely stand upright ; she sees there some wine, and declares that under this spot has been hidden a treasure contained in a small strong box, in which she perceives jewels, silver, and plate. She goes on giving descriptions, superfluous for the reader to know, but very agreeable for this lady to hear. The day after this sitting, the lady returned to acquaint me that she had. been again to see her somnambulist, who held with her, as near as may be, this discourse : " You ought to be satisfied with the clairvoyante I made you acquainted with. 1 fear but one thing, which is, that her lucidity should deprive me of your kind visits, for I am very much attached to you ; it was to give you a proof of this that I feared not making you acquainted with another clairvoyante more powerful than myself. I perceive that she spoke to you of a spirit that wandered. about the property she visited, the result of a murder : that is very true ; I see it also. It is a pity that this clairvoyante should be too reserved and too much afraid of telling us all she sees ; there would be moments wherein she would confound the most incredulous. She is too fearful of committing mistakes ; her magnetizer ought to know that." I replied to this lady, that it was true that if Adele was a little less afraid of committing mistakes, she would be capable of greater things. It is her reserve that proves her lucidity ; she is aware how pictures which present themselves to the eye may lead to error, seeing that they represent the past, present, and future, as present, although in the world of causes, wherein are perceived the various states of their manifestation, there can be no errors: however, they are possible in their material efl*ects, which are or are not manifested. If man studied with great attention this somnambulic or spiritual state, which he yet knows but imperfectly, he would not be so ready to inveigli against errors, especially if unable to verify the revelations of the clairvoyantes. I have spoken of this curious sitting merely to have an opportunity of repeating what I have already said in the first volume, that it was not necessary to guide clairvoyantes, step by step, toward the object we desire to have visited by them ; for Adele, at this sitting, formed no communication with the lady : she asked for the chateau, and it forthwith appeared. What has made me thus act, is, that knowino- a clairvoyante able to find out the traces of an object stolen or lost, of a person missing, &c., in these researches, he can be guided by no human thought ; the desired object, therefore, must present itself at the call of the clairvoyante, or the latter must proceed toward it without any itinerary. It may then, I say to myself, be the sam.e with all views at a distance ; of this I have obtained proof a hundred times. Even yesterday, a doctor of high repute, who believes in magnetism because he is so under my influence that I force him to confess it (whenever he seems disposed to deviate from the truth) that he can offer no opposition to my closing his eyes, for instance, if I will it, until he begs of me to open them for him (and he does not sleep) — he was in the same disposition of mind with regard to somnambulism and views at a distance, when yesterday, as I was saying, I somnambulized my little Emile, and intrusted him to the doctor to question him at his ease. Out of more than forty answers, he raised doubts only on two or three made by a spirit whom he caused to be questioned at a distance. His surprise was not less great when I assured him that the really living person whose spirit responded to that of my little clairvoyante, of twelve years of age, knew nothing of this little secret intriguing and those confidences, in which, however, he would have taken good care not to compromise himself by answers injurious to him. The doctor, before taking the hand of the clairvoyante, had already a description of the house into which he had sent him. On this simple invitation from me to the child : " The doctor desires that you should see a house into which he wishes you to enter." " I see it," forthwith said the child, " it is a new house," &c. This method of proceeding would not bo admissible unless it succeeded as well as the other; but is it not demonstrated by the aforementioned experiment for researches, thefts, &c., so common in our days 1 What makes me more attached to these experiments is, that I wish to prove, that if an object unknown to the clairvoyante presents itself to his view, agreeably to his wishes — if actions passed like those attending all the circumstances of a theft, or the journey of a person whose trace has been lost, present themselves to him — I say, the person who has done or produced these actions, must exist equally as well as those actions which appear to our material eyes completely dead ; and the soul which has produced such thinffs can no more refuse to come, at the call of the clairvoyante, than these scenes refuse appearing. I wish also to observe, that the clairvoyante who addressed Madame Devaux has not the least knowledge of Adele in her watchful state, and the same may be said of Adele with regard to her. I will say, moreover, that in the view at distance Adele took, it must be observed that she declares it impossible for her to stand upright in the store-room, which really is, as this lady has said, too small to admit of her doing so materially. It is, therefore, not the view alone that goes toward that spot — it is the whole spiritual individual, as I have already remarked at the commencement of this volume, in my answer to magnetizers who believe that apparitions are a transmission of thoughts, and as I have proved in the view Adele took of Mexico, in which she received a coup-de-soleil (though it was rainy weather). It can not be for a moment doubted but that the clairvoyante is wholly in the places he visits at a distance, although answering our questions by the organs of his material body, as if still within it. If, perchance, it should be arg-ued that he sees these thing-s in the thought of the questioner, although the contrary is mathematically proved by the details present, which he gives you of places you have not seen for many years, and the changes that have taken place since your departure ; these details can not be in your thoughts, since you are not acquainted with them, and ulterior information only proves to you their reality. This is a logical proof, admitting of no reply ; but, as there are persons who have a reply for all, and who, prejudiced in their belief of the transmission of thoughts, see but it, I beg them to tell me how a clairvoyante can walk about in the least of their thoucrhts, which represents a place capable of containing thousands of spirits similar to the one visiting them. If I ask a solution of this from these savans, it is less to combat the truth of it than to fix for an instant their vast conception on this explanation, by which they believe they have nothing more to reply. I will tell them that it deserves a little more attention, and can not, though really existing, answer the question I address to them. Does the clairvoyante see only what you have seen or thought? Certainly not ; since every day you obtain proofs of the contrary. In that case, then, where does he see these things 1 Where they are, no doubt. And they are, where we suppose them materially to be, far from us. If they are far from us, and the spirit goes to visit them, in body and not in sight — as it is easy for you to make sure of— who can convey it to these places, the doors being shut, and the walls well cemented ? Answer, I say to you. Is it the places that come to your clairvoyante 1 Who brings these places into your room ? I puzzle you a little more than I shall be puzzled, in answering you that the soul, disengaged from matter, has no more difficulties to encounter in coming at your request than the clairvoyante experiences in going unseen by your material eyes to those remote places, or than those places have in coming to you.

>Theo. In many ways. The causes of such manifestations are by no means so simple as the Spiritualists would like to believe. Foremost of all, the deus ex machina of the so-called "materializations" is usually the astral body or "double" of the medium or of some one present. This astral body is also the producer or operating force in the manifestations of slate-writing, "Davenport"-like manifestations, and so on.

>19. " You told me yesterday that spirits in some form or other, introduced themselves into our bodies, to torment us at their pleasure under the mask of disease ; we are, then, the veriest slaves of the universe ; it is by no means to be presumed that we are the sport of such or such a spirit, according to his caprice." " What I told you yesterday, is the fruit of my knowledge in the state I am ; it is my conviction. I speak of what I behold with my own eyes, and I defy any somnambulist, having the light I have, to belie me." — *' How is it that a spirit that must have some form, can take that of a trifling swelling, of wind, &c. ; it is impossible, incomprehensible !" " It is owing to our inability to comprehend it that they do so ; were there nothing miraculous in their actions, they would not be superior to us ; could they do the mischief to each other that they do to us, they would not make us their victims, but as they can neither deceive nor influence one another, they of necessity torment us; and, as I have already told you, the man who by their counsels devotes himself to the doing of evil, calls them even to his assistance. When he quits the earth, he takes the place of the spirit who led him into evil, and the latter passes into a sphere where his evil thoughts no longer accompany him ; thus proceeds the purification from the earth to God." — " You have, however, told me that wicked spirits had a mission for evil ; that this evil was beneficial; that God punished not the guilty." " I told you, it is true, that evil was beneficial, but in order to be put in execution it must assume a form. It is not your good angel who will give a form to evil ; his mission is to give or apply a form to good : it is, therefn'e, the evil one that is obliged to apply evil in order to satisfy his want of enjoying his work. If he had not the taste of acting thus, evil could not exist ; then he can draw from it, and raise up for us a host of evils, each of which represents an evil spirit or its action. The good one acts quite the reverse, and thus it happens that this perpetual conflict of good and evil can not terminate so long as the material man exists. This, then, was the reason for my telling you, and I repeat it, that all the angels and the evil spirits that are on the earth in pairs beside us to lead us to good and evil, as we lead a child, have been men on earth ; it is only since they quitted it that they are what they are, and it may easily be divined from his very inclinations what part a man living on earth will play after quitting it : the more he has desired to do evil, the more he will cause to be done when, in his turn, he shall be called upon as a guide, instead of being, as he was on earth, guided ; it is a chain that runs ad infinitum ^ many links of which are still hidden from us." — "You just now told me that spirits can not influence each other, how is it that a little ptisan or a cataplasm cures the swelling or inflammation which you represent as an evil spirit?" " I told you that they had no influence over each other in the spiritual world ; but on earth it is different, seeing that it is on this continual influence that our life depends ; and I will answer you that the remedy you apply is the influence of the good spirit in the form of a •flower or grain, and thus it is that they drive each other out by remedial applications, or their contraries, in material forms which they can influence at will." — " In that case all that exists is but a compound of spirits." " Certainly, in so far as they can invest all the forms of it, that there is nothing dead in nature, and that all that exists is divided into two camps, the one good, the other bad, or I should rightly say" " While you are about it, say ; keep back nothing ; your system does not displease me." ** Well, I wall tell you that good and evil are what they are only because we find ourselves in positions wherein we are unable to appreciate their effects ; for, according to the position, evil is a good for one, and good is an evil for the other. Such we perceive to be the case with fire, which effects the greatest good when we stand in need of it, and annoys when it is not required ; not that I pretend by this that a man who breaks his thigh derives good from it; but, although this accident in our eyes is in the category of evil, the doctor, and all those who live on the evil of others, find therein as much good as the patient does evil : so, judge." — " I acknowledge that you are ingenious." " I am right." — " I don't deny it."

>69. " Has the soul any recollection of the earth and of what it was there V " Yes." — " Can it perceive matter ?" " No." — " Does it regret the material life ?" " No." — " Can it at will visit its relations, its friends V " Yes ; when it is requested in the state necessary to be seen as your clairvovante is." — " Can it in aught influence their existence?" "Yes; in the good which it invariahly counsels tliem to do.'" " Can it inform them of any particularity in their destiny V " Yes ; bat it does so with much prudence, especially when it foresees the effect that the revelation will create in the moral being ; for this reason it is compelled not to tell all." — " Does it suffer much in quitting its body ?" " More or less." — " Is it long before it becomes acquainted with the state into which it enters V " It becomes acquainted with it immediately." — " You have just told me that a spirit can not perceive matter ; how can you come into this house, close to us, without seeing us V " I am conscious of this young lady's spirit which attracts me, and I find myself with her, agreeably to her desire and mine." — " Still, proofs exist that some spirits see m^atter, since they upset articles of furniture, vases, &c., convey messages and objects." "Those are evil spirits that are in the circle surrounding the earth, that sli]l hover over it, and do these things." — " It is not only evil spirits, however, that possess this property. I have read several works of saints who have performed or seen some of those phenomena. M. Billot, a very pious man, has received messages of the kind from the hands even of angels]" " It is very seldom that the Deity permits these kind of conveyances ; they can not take place unknown to heaven." — " M. Possin not long ago said that he received a crown through the medium of his clairvoyante ?" " There has been nothing similar to this in heaven of late." — " In short, we have also a cu?-e who, in a small provincial parish where there was a scarcity of corn, had his granary filled agreeably to his wishes ; he disti'ibuted this godsend among his parishioners, and yet, it is said, the granary was not exhausted. There are multitudes of similar facts in the holy books V " There are many things written which have never existed ; many others which are, as I have told you, the province of spirits occupied in things of this kind ; but in order for a man to obtain such favors from heaven, his soul must be very pure, have in view but the happiness of his fellow-beings, and an ardent desire to render himself acceptable to God. Such men and such facts are rare ; but they do exist and have existed. "We should ever suspect conveyances and messages of this kind, as they are frequently but a stratagem of evil spirits that wish to flatter our pride and incredulity the better to obtain dominion over us." — " In short, since you say that such things may exist through the intercession of angels, as through tliat of evil spirits, it must needs be that they see ihe object which they convey V " Certainly they see it ; but ihey take it from the earth, for in heaven there is nothing material ; when such a thing happens, it is, as I have told you, as great a miracle for heaven as for the earth." — " You conclude that the spirits of heaven do not perceive matter V ** I have told you so, saving under the conditions which I have just made known to you." — " You told me that you felt yourself attracted by the will of my clairvoyante ; could you not correspond in thouo-ht with me, by answering through her the questions I should mentally transmit to you ?" " I could do so; but that presents difficulties which would bring in their train errors, and require much more time, inasmuch as you are not in the spiritual state, and such communication is too difficult," I deem it fit to address these questions to M. Mallet, although we have ali-eady seen them addressed to other spirits; we can not receive too many confirmations in this respect ; we should question all persuasions, in order to come to a correct understanding.

>108. When I intrusted to the printer my manuscript of the " Secrets," I had not a duplicate of it, my employment permitting me not to copy such a work : I recommended it, therefore, to M. Mirande, director of the printing-office, harassed as I was by a secret inquietude, still further augmented by the somewhat unfavorable disposition of mind into which my prospectus had thrown certain members of different sects. Several of them having come to me for more ample information as to the religious tendency of this work, I had frankly answered them that my object was to tell all that had been revealed to me, without, in aught, perverting the meaning to the advantage of any particular belief. I agreed not with these gentlemen for two reason : 1. I believe God to be infinitely good — not subject to fits of vengeance and cruelty. 2. I believe that in all religions we might be saved. No more was necessary for these stupid and egotistical men to make them augur ill of the soundness of my work. One day a disciple of Swedenborg quitted me, saying : " Monsieur, with such disposition of mind, you can but have written your work under a very bad influence. It could not have been M. Swedenborg who came to you ; but I predict to you that in a few days he will appear in person to you yourself, to undeceive you and forbid you printing it." I answered this gentleman, that '• the day I should have the honor of such a visit would be one of the happiest of my life." He quitted me in a very bad humor, being unable to contain his displeasure before a lady present, who was a follower of Swedenborg, and worthy of respect fi'om her great age and enlightened understanding, the fruit of long and painful meditations. Matters stood thus. A vexatious idea came into my head, that if it were possible, certain persons inimical to this work might make away with it. One day I received a proof to correct, with a part of the manuscript, of which it was the reproduction. What was my surprise on seeing that twenty-six pages of the manuscript had been so burned that it was very difficult to read their contents : these pages were actually those containing all the revelations of M. Swedenborg. I was confounded. Next day M. Mirande came to my house : I begged him frankly to tell me, since this accident had been attended by no untoward results, whether it had occurred before, during, or after the com230sition. This gentleman replied that it happened before the composition, in the room of the reader. The latter was about looking over the manuscript ; some one came to speak to him ; he laid down this part on the top of his stove, which was very hot at that moment, and perceived his distraction only from a strong smell of burning; he instantly withdrew my manuscript, which, had it remained there a second lonsj'er, would have been annihilated. I knew not what to think of such an accident, when yesterday I asked M. Swedenborg the cause of it. He replied : " This accident was prepared by evil spirits, who wanted to annihilate the truths I have revealed to you." — " Is it to you that I am indebted for its non-execution V *' Let it suffice you to know that good spirits watched over its preservation, as they watch over yours and your claitvoyante's. Had these evil spirits the power, they would lay a spell on you. But fear not ; those who conceived such vengeance will be the first to read you, and will learn to repent of their error. You ought to remember that I came the morning after this accident, to assure you that your work would appear unshackled, for such is the will of God. Be calm : among my disciples, as in all religions, there are false men who pervert to their profit my writings ; but they will not succeed in establishing their doctrines." I did not exactly recollect, not having taken down the dale, whether M. Swedenborg: came to see Adele the morninsf after this accident ; but I still await the fulfilment of the prediction of his disciple, and I think that, after reading this work, he will be enabled to judge whether it has been dictated by the evil one, or l)y a beneficent spirit. I availed myself of the presence of M. Swedenborg to put to him the following question : " At the last sitting you explained to me how years were estimated in heaven ; but I did not perfectly comprehend your explanation : could you furnish me with a little additional information on this point]" "In heaven there are no years as on earth; I have told you that children dying before the age of seven years, were all crowned at that age, and those fifteen years old in like manner. I merely borrowed the word * years' as a figurative expression, to make myself understood by your clairvoyante, for in heaven they are degrees. The age of seven years represents the degree of knowledge ; that of fifteen the degree of love, and so on." Adele said to me : " It is true that M. Swedenborg always spoke to me of degrees; but, not comprehending these degrees, I begged him to explain this to me otherwise, in order that I might the better reproduce to you what he said to me ; for if I do not myself comprehend, how should I make you do so ? Then again, he told me that time was not reckoned in heaven, where all was by degrees of affection. On earth, children seven years of age, are, it is said, at the age of knowledge ; it is this want of knowledge that is crowned in heaven : the child, were it not to enter this degree till after twenty of our years, represents the child of seven years with us. It is the same with respect to the age of fifteen, when we feel on earth the first approaches of love. In heaven it is a degree — an affection similar to that of the child entering the state of knowledge. There is no limited time : when this affection enters the person, we say he is in the degree of love, which corresponds to the age of fifteen on our earth." I am aware that some of M. Swedenhorg's works treat of degrees, but I am not acquainted with them. (I leave the reader to judge of the revelations of this sitting, in respect to the accident that befell my manuscript.)

>Again, the “primitive history" relates that "God saw that it was not good for man to be alone. So he caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And of the rib made he a woman, and gave her unto the man." This the eastern chieftain taught in the following manner, and thus is it written in the Sanskrit: "And while their fathers were pleased with the beauty of the good spirit about them, they felt lonely; and while they felt thus, Parama　caused them to be asleep. And while they were still as the great waters, the good spirit sent them from his hand a weaker number of mothers and other brethren. And the good spirit caused the fathers to awake: and they beheld each other, and our fathers loved them. And then they lived together, one with another: and the good spirit Parama was pleased."

>Being thus socially united, they were not led to conceive of gross errors: for errors spring from social disunity and disorganization and from a misapprehension of the cause of existing evil. Having imbibed and retained the impression received by their early forefathers, they proceeded to reconcile this impression with the manifestation of all things about and above them. So they saw that the "breaths" were not evil to them as their fathers had taught, but instead of this they supposed that they proceeded from a good spirit, who desired to fan their heated brows after they had toiled and traveled excessively in the light of the Good Spirit. So when fatigued and exhausted by toilsome travels, they would rest confidingly under the protection of the Great Spirit who had formed their world, and would joyously receive his refreshing breath, that carne, as they supposed, from some of the good subordinate spirits. They saw that these "breaths" were generally good for them; and this manifestation of goodness unfolded the tender dispositions of their nature, and they dwelt in love one with another. And these truthful conceptions, and their tranquillizing influences, descended through all the succeeding generations of this people down to the present time.

>They believed that the eye, the tongue — that plants, animals, and all the celestial orbs —had spirits in attendance. They believed that the power of speaking was communicated to them by the spirit of the tongue, and so also the power of seeing by the spirit of the eye. They loved, adored, and worshipped, the Sun: for it made their earth fertile in all the things which they cultivated. They worshipped the Moon: for it was a good spirit to give them light while the warm and better spirit had gone to rest. They beheld the stars with awe and admiration: because they were little lights held out by the good spirits to give them light, and to make their earth look beautiful when the sun and the moon had retired to rest. They believed that when they should lie down and die, the spirit of their eyes and tongue would convey the spirit that was within them to the beautiful habitations of the spirit-land. They felt conscious that the spirit-land was analogous to the one on which they dwelt, in all its productions, so that there they might hunt, adore the good spirits, and love one another; and it was therefore to them a land of transcendent beauty and grandeur. There they would not see any more the spirit of the waters. And there they would not die any more, neither dislike nor injure one another; but would be near the placid waters, and the meandering streams, and in the forests and gardens of beauty and delight. There they would see the shining fish, the gilded birds, and the gentle animals, that would not resist their grasp. There they would behold the Good Spirit, while the vaulted chambers above would be illuminated by all the grandeur and magnificence possible to conceive.

>" Having thus conferred together, and resolved upon treating the subject seriously, remove from the patient all such persons as might annoy you, and keep none but the necessary witnesses (one only, if possible,) in the room. Then prepare yourself so as to be neither too warm nor too cold, and to enjoy perfect freedom in your gestures ; you should also take your precautions not to be interrupted during the sitting. These preliminaries arranged, seat your patient as conveniently as possible, and place yourself opposite to him, on a seat rather more elevated than his, so as to hold his knees between yours, and to touch your feet with his own. Request him to give himself up, to think of nothing, and not to distract his attention by examining the effects he may experience ; to be full of hope, and not to be uneasy or alarmed, should the magnetic influence produce in him momentary pains. After having composed yourself, hold his thumbs between your fingers, so that the inside of your thumbs may touch the inside of his, and fix your eyes upon him. You may remain from two to five minutes in this position, or until you feel that your thumbs and his are at the same temperature. This being done, you must withdraw your hands, by moving them outwardly right and left, so that the inward surface be turned outwards, and raise them as high as the head ; you must then lay them on both shoulders, and leave them there for about one minute ; then bring them down along the arms to the extremity of the fingers, touching slightly all the way. You will repeat this manipulation five or six times, keeping your hands off the body when you raise them. You will then hold your hands above the head for a moment, and draw them down before the face, at a distance of about two inches, as low as the pit of the stomach. Here you will stop again for about two minutes, laying your thumbs on the pit of the stomach, and your fingers under the ribs. You will then slowly come down the body as low as the knees. These manipulations should be repeated during the greater part of the sitting. You will also occasionally come nearer to the patient, so as to lay your hands behind his shoulders, and bring them slowly down the spine, and thence over the hips and along the thighs, down to the knees or to the feet. When you wish to bring the sitting to a close, you must take care to draw the magnetic fluid to the extremities of the hands and feet, by lengthening your line of motion beyond these extremities, each time shaking your fingers. Lastly, you will make before the face, and even before the breast, a few transverse manipulations, at a distance of three or four inches. It is essential to magnetise invariably downward from the head toward the extremities, and never upwards from the extremities towards the head. The downward manipulations are magnetic, — that is, they are accompanied with the intention of magnetising. The movements made upwards are not so. When the magnetiser operates upon the magnetisee, they are said to be en rapport — which means a peculiar and acquired disposition, by virtue of which the magnetiser exerts an influence upon the magnetisee ; in other words, a communication of vital principle is^established between them ; and when this has once taken place, the magnetic action is renewed at every subsequent sitting, the instant the operation begins."

>Theo. We assert that the divine spark in man being one and identical in its essence with the Universal Spirit, our "spiritual Self" is practically omniscient, but that it cannot manifest its knowledge owing to the impediments of matter. Now the more these impediments are removed, in other words, the more the physical body is paralyzed, as to its own independent activity and consciousness, as in deep sleep or deep trance, or, again, in illness, the more fully can the inner Self manifest on this plane. This is our explanation of those truly wonderful phenomena of a higher order, in which undeniable intelligence and knowledge are exhibited. As to the lower order of manifestations, such as physical phenomena and the platitudes and common talk of the general "spirit," to explain even the most important of the teachings we hold upon the subject would take up more space and time than can be allotted to it at present. We have no desire to interfere with the belief of the Spiritualists any more than with any other belief. The onus probandi must fall on the believers in "spirits." And at the present moment, while still convinced that the higher sort of manifestations occur through the disembodied souls, their leaders and the most learned and intelligent among the Spiritualists are the first to confess that not all the phenomena are produced by spirits. Gradually they will come to recognise the whole truth; but meanwhile we have no right nor desire to proselytize them to our views. The less so, as in the cases of purely psychic and spiritual manifestations we believe in the intercommunication of the spirit of the living man with that of disembodied personalities.*

"I mean that a person with whom you have no longer friendly relations is the cause of your being beset by an evil spirit." — " What power can this spirit have over me. I in no wise dread him ; I have never experienced any effect from him V " Ah ! such are men who dread nothing ; but know, once for all, that your power is a complete nullity before the spirit; it is the spirit that moves matter ; it is that which possesses action and force, and God alone knows what force a spirit can display? You Bay that you have never felt the influence of the one I speak of; do you not recollect that about three years ago, you experienced a painful oppression in your slumbers ; you had dreadful visions, and, if you would confess it, you were raised up in your bed, and even now you must experience much difficulty in going to sleep," — " True it is that for a long time I have had at night nervous attacks which I attribute to the weakness of my constitution. I have had also painful dreams ; but that does not prove to me that it is a spirit sent especially by the person you have mentioned, who can have caused this trouble." " Let it suffice you to know that you ought to have been aware of the power of a spirit, because you desired to see one, touch one ; you have been heard. You do not tell me the whole truth ; my guide says so, and he adds that if the angel of light who guides you had not been so powerful you would have seen others; you might have been beaten, thrown out of your bed ; you are fortunate at having got off with so little ; pray, and you will soon be rid of it." — " I do not very well understand what you tell me ; things have passed which in truth have caused me much surprise and suffering ; but I always attributed these facts to nervous irritation or some other material cause." " It is true that the sufferings you have experienced are owing to your nervous system : but all that has reference to the intelligence, was under the dependence of this evil spirit." — " You say that it was a spirit sent to me ; this person is altogether innocent of intriguing, and I am certain that you are in error." " I will explain to you how it has been brought about. The difference that happened between you and this person, who is several leagues off, took place by correspondence; you wrote something that offended this person, who has ever been jealous of you ; he answered you under the influence of the contrariety he experienced. This person has very acrid humors, very ardent desires, he could have wished you at the very deuce : he wrote to you things that gave you much pain ; the letter was the conductor of this bad choleric fluid ; the nervous state in which you then were conduced to your being invaded by this fluid ; the disposition of mind in which you were, independent of this circumstance, facilitated the introduction of this spirit within you ; under the nature of this fluid, you directly asked to see spirits, in which you did not then believe, and both circumstances contributed toward placing you in a state of obsession. Drive back with all your might this fluid on the person I have named ; pray, and you will be released, and I shall be lucid."

>I must not terminate this sitting without making mention of a somewhat similar revelation of which I was once a witness at a party to which I had been invited to see a somnambulist who was singularly susceptible of the physical influence of her magnetizer. A gentleman approaches her to consult her as to an indisposition he experienced, and, I believe, to know at the same time what to think of somnambulism. Scarcely was she in communication with him than she said to him : " Your complaint is not in the least dangerous ; it is an inflammation caused by an unfortunate passion you have." — " What passion V* asked he. " You will not take offence if I mention it before company." — " Mention it ; I have naught to reproach myself with." " You are too often thirsty." — Every one began to laugh, following the example of the consulter. " I have not always had this failing," replied he. " I perceive it, and I also perceive the cause," — " What is it ?" " A long, long time ago, you passionately loved a young person ; she did not return your love, because you were not disposed to wed her, for good reasons which you then had. You left that part of the country in which she lives, and since that time she conceived such a hatred toward you that she wished you all possible harm; you became a victim to her evil influence." — " What do you mean by that V " I mean that from that period you have been under the influence of an evil spirit, that has disordered your conduct, by kindling in you a fire which you always thought you could extinguish or moderate, by giving yourself up to drink ; and, what is more, those desires for drink are in you periodical." — " What you tell me is exact as to the circumstance and my failing ; but I can not believe that such is the real cause." *' You clearly perceive, however, that I tell you the truth on one point, I do not deceive you on the other; but don't be down-hearted, there is a remedy." — " Drinking no more, doubtless '?" " Oh ! you could not leave it off of yourself; there is no power but that 1 shall point out to you that can set you free." — " Tell me what that power is ?" ** At night, before going to bed, kneel down, pray to God from the bottom of your heart to deliver you from this failing ; then, rise, animate your thoughts by the recollection of what I tell you, strive to pass into a state of exaltation, then raise your arms, fancying to yourself that this person is present before you, and cast at her, with disdain and wrath, the evil fluid with which you are impregnated, saying, ' Evil spirit who besettest me, flee far from me, in the name of God, the sole Creator, thy master and mine; return to the source whence thou earnest.' Pray your good angel to aid you in this operation ; do this until you are released, and you will not be long before being so, I assure you." — " How would you have the fluid of which you speak rejoin that woman who is more than a hundred and fifty leagues from here ?" " Fancying to yourself that she is in your room, she will no longer be a hundred and fifty leagues off." — " I can't comprehend that." " Act withou*t comprehending, and you will see." The magnetizer, who believes not in spirits, but takes much delight in rendering his somnambulist cataleptic, resumed his experiments without paying any attention to what he had just heard. As this revelation bore so close an affinity to those of Bl^uno and my other ecstatics, I took note of it, and now mention it, deeming this to be an appropriate place, in order to fix the thoughts of the reader on this kind of possession. True that this is raising new difficulties as to the existence or nonexistence of free-will, and apparently in favor of the latter belief. However, this kind of alienation of the faculties of men could not be generalized, and this power of a few beings over their fellows would rather seem merely an assemblage of two organizations, one of which is destined to subdue or dominate the other for a time and similar enough to the power of magnetism, which is null before an organization that enters not into correspondence with it ; unfortunate, indeed, would it be were it otherwise ; the mere wish of an enemy would suffice to reduce you to a state the most abject and dependent; I repeat, however, that it is possible.

>died on such a day, at such an hour, because she had heard herself thrice called by the voice of that lady, although the coincidence was exact, my incredulity remained unshaken. * Some such thing will happen to yourself,' said my mother, ' and then you will believe.' — ' I will search into it,' said I, * and find out, be you assured, some physical cause for it.' imploring the assistance of the spirits that facilitate such experiments. M. de Laborde makes use of a brilliant ink which he puts in the hollow of the looker's hand, and stimulates his nervous system by perfumes. M. Dupotet makes use of a piece of coal with which he describes a circle on the floor, with the intention of making perceptible to the person operated upon such picture as the latter desires; he keeps the subject inclined for this experiment by thought. Sorcerers have their reputation which is of great assistance to them. Certain prepossessions against such or such a person suspected of theft or aught else, their imposing air, their supplication to such spirit familiar to them, without knowing positively the meaning of what they say — this suffices, and they operate ! Leon, of whom I have spoken, followed in their steps ; prayer, failh, and a disposition of the visual organ, facilitated his experiments. Cagliostro, preceded by his reputation as an incomprehensible man, was often successful in consequence of the tact he displayed in selecting his pupils, the occult magnetism he employed, &c. ; but if 1 ask Messrs. de Laborde, Dupotet, Cagliostro, the sorcerers, Leon and others, whether they saw themselves in their mirrors or reflecting body, they will reply no ; therefore, there must be a disposition for this kind of exjteriment, we must be influenced by an imposing display, an occult magnetism, or the aid of invocations and perfumes. Wherefoie, in order to profit by my mirror, I would advise the ceremony to be performed with a certain dignity, and to have recourse only to what may act on the imagination or nerves ; as much by a moral or spiritual magnetism as by the assistance of perfumes. All those that bear or shed a sweet, pleasant smell, are suitable for the good spirits, such as incense, musk, gum-lac, &c. ; and for evil spirits, the seeds of henbane, hemp, belladonna, anise, or coriander, &c. Each seeks his own atmosphere, or one akin to it ; but, above all, shun the assistance of evil spirits. Let the spirit of justice, discretion, humanity, predominate in you : or, otherwise, wo betide you !

>101. After many indifferent questions which I had addressed to M. Swedenborg, I put to him the following ones (through the medium, be it understood, of Adele) : " 1 have not the means of printing the first volume of the ' Secrets,' a good part of which you dictated to me. I have spoken of it to several publishers, who politely refused me because I had not a literary name ; could you point out to me the means of attaining my object without their assistance V " No ; it is a very difficult matter. I know the trouble mine cost me to publish." — '* Did you publish them at your own expense, or did God supply you with the means by occult causes or transmissions of money '?" " T printed my works at my own expense, but sold very few in my time. Nobody would read them. In fifty years it will be the same with yours as with mine at the present time ; they will be read with pleasure. I received nothing from spirits." — " Still they have the power of making such transmissions ?" " Yes ; but it is never good to ask them for them." — " AVhy so ?" " Because it is ordinarily evil spirits that have this affection." — " For what object ]" " To draw you into their society." — " What is the consequence of such alliance with theml" " Living with them, and doing for others what they have done for you." — " I can see in that but good." " Yes, so far ; but this good is always done in some interest or other that must sooner or later be paid for." — " Is any suffering the result for the person obliged ?" " Yes, in this sense, that he finds himself allied with a society whose usages are not in harmony with his affections. We can not extricate ourselves from this constraint before a certain time. If you had the affections of these societies, you would not suffer with them ; but, not having them, I advise you to maintain your independence." — " None but evil spirifs have the power of making such transmissions ?" " The good have likewise tliis power." — " Why do they not oftener make use of it T' " Because to deserve these favors of God, we ourselves must be as pure as beneficent. Few men exist who merit them. The good spirits know that the more we suffer on earlh, the more agreeable we find the joys of heaven; and then, again, they trouble themselves so little about the earth !" — " One of my friends, M. R***, assured me that he found, some time ago, fifty francs scattered about the place where he locks up his money. He was in great difhcullies, having but ten francs to last him out the month. He prayed, and the following morning he found the sum." " M. R*** may have been mistaken ; possibly he had laid by this money somewhere, but could not recollect where ; for my part, I do not believe that there is any transmission in this circumstance, but still I may be mistaken." — " You grant that there exist good and evil spirits that have this property 1" " Yes." — *' Could you direct one to me ?" *• No, I have no wish to do so ; I advise you not to try it, we should be weJl acquainted with a spirit before thus giving ourselves up to it." Adele is unwilling to proceed, telling me that she will never be an interpreter to such arrangements ; that 1 have no reason to be uneasy about my book, as it would be published by some one who would appear in time for that purpose. 1 went on submitting to her several questions, which she answered agreeably to my wishes, and continued thus : " For my part, I do n't think it possible for me to tell you any more. Your work recapitulates, in this sense, all that it is possible to teach men as to the future life. Did they know more of it, they would bitterly curse the earth, and find the joys of heaven much less sweet. Though we can not form a just idea of celestial happiness, we find a pleasure which we trace little by little beforehand, less captivating. Besides, there exist mysteries which can not be explained. All this is so foreign to our material laws, that the time would be spent to no purpose in wishing to make you comprehend what it is not given you to comprehend.

>6. On a mentor, who superintends their education; Ai's had told me in a former sitting, that a saint instructed them. This child is so lively that he scarcely awaits the answers made him ; to this may bo attributed the mistake he made as to the decease of the father of Ais. We see by M. Swedenborg, as by M. Mallet, that a number consists of 20. 7. There is also accord as to the coronation. 8. As to the festivals. 9. As to the possible union and caresses of two children. 10. As to their belief, in communicating with each other, through speech ; this, also, Emile had told me, when, on the contrary, it is through thought, through sensation. Here, then, are ten secrets in which they perfectly agree. It is necessary to observe that I did not magnetize this child once in two months, his mother having an objection to it. We may judge what facility is prepared for somnambulists in communicating with the deceased, especially when rightly brought up for this purpose, and prU' dently guided in this speciality. I return to an observation to which I did not give sufficient importance : that is, to prepare the questions we desire to address, not to suffer ourselves to be led away by those raised by the answers we obtain; keep them for the next sitting, you will have had time to reflect on them, and prepare them better. They may, sometimes, accord with others that have preceded them, which would be a needless repetition, for we have been enabled to appreciate that an answer very often contains several solutions ; hence it is, that at the first sitting, Binet used to say to me : " You have already been answered that question." — I did not believe it; I had not comprehended him, and I found at a later period that he was right. Such conversations, likewise, present in the reading a void which is, at times, painful. It will be understood that this is not a history whose every detail should be consigned with harmony and a certain elegance of style, in order to arailse. Here we instruct ourselves, pick up information in the road of the infinite, the unknown, to construct the universal history of creation and the human destination. We are but a very poor workman for a monument so colossal. A skilful architect will one day come to unite these materials, and adorn with them the edifice at which we have been courageously working for so many years. Many questions, also, are found unanswered ; the spirit, no doubt, perceiving that our intelligence is not open to such revelations. It is silent — and we insist not. "We ask for the spiritual obole with humility, and stop in time when we find that we are importunate.

>Many magnetizers are easily enough disgusted with somnambulism ; good somnambulists are always useful to consult; it is very frequently the magnetizers who disorganize them by the strangeness of their questions. We should be convinced, once for all, that it is necessary to train every somnambulist to one speciality, suited to his tastes and the kind of instruction we desire. How conceive that a somnambulist should answer at the same sitting questions hurried, and so little in accord as these : " Can you tell me what I have in my pocket V* ** Can you read this letter?" " Can you see where I suffer?" " Can you tell me what my brother is doing in Africa V* " Can you see whether I shall gain such a law-suit V " Can you tell what such a person thinks of me ?" " Will the lotteryticket I have purchased turn up a prize?" " Can you tell me what has become of my husband, whom I have not seen these twenty years ?" and a thousand other like questions. The world thinks that a somnambulist who sees and knows a certain thing can see and know all. The magnetizer himself is no less insatiable. Consider that mistakes must be the consequence of such a mode of operating ; too many are often made even in following a route with great circumspection. What can we expect from such a chaos of questions ? Deception for all, shame and vexation for the magnetizer, and insanity or stupidity for the somnambulist thus tortured ; fortunate for him if physical tortures be not added to moral ones. I am not at all surprised that somnambulism should lose in the public mind its sacred and divine character. You wish to learn so much from it that you know nothing. If, in spiritual researches, we were to proceed in this way, we should obtain but very little. It is necessary, as I have said, to write down beforehand the questions we intend putting — acquaint the clairvoyante with them, that he may prepare for them. These questions should be clear and few in number, touching only on one subject, with no objections, and thus terminating the sitting. The answers obtained will supply new questions for the following sitting. Never make two similar experiments at the same sitting y if you would succeed ; no pride, no interested calculation. Be jDatient, kind. The stone that caused your fall to-day should warn you to pick out a better road. It is for you to guide your clairvoyante in it carefully and firmly.
# Progression

>Otherwise how could one account for, and explain mathematically, the evolutionary and spiral progress of the four kingdoms? The Monad is the combination of the last two principles in man, the sixth and the seventh, and, properly speaking, the term “Human Monad” applies only to the Dual Soul (Âtmâ‐Buddhi), not to its highest spiritual vivifying principle, Âtmâ, alone. But since the Spiritual Soul, if divorced from the latter (Âtmâ), could have no existence, no being, it has thus been called.... Now the Monadic, or rather Cosmic, Essence, if such a term be permitted, in the mineral, vegetable and animal, though the same throughout the series of cycles, from the lowest elemental up to the Deva kingdom, yet differs in the scale of progression. It would be very misleading to imagine a Monad as a separate Entity, trailing its slow way in a distinct path through the lower kingdoms, and after an incalculable series of transformations flowering into a human being; in short, that the Monad of a Humboldt dates back to the Monad of an atom of hornblende. Instead of saying a “Mineral Monad,” the more correct phraseology in Physical Science, which differentiates every atom, would of course have been to call it “the Monad manifesting in that form of Prakriti called ‘the Mineral Kingdom’.” The atom, as represented in the ordinary scientific hypothesis, is not a particle of something, animated by a psychic something, destined after æons to blossom into a man. But it is a concrete manifestation of the Universal Energy, which itself has not yet become individualized; a sequential manifestation of the one Universal Monas. The Ocean of Matter does not divide into its potential and constituent drops, until the sweep of the life‐impulse reaches the evolutionary stage of man- birth. The tendency towards segregation into individual Monads is gradual, and in the higher animals comes almost to the point. The Peripatetics applied the word Monas to the whole Kosmos, in the pantheistic sense; and the Occultists, while accepting this thought for convenience sake, distinguish the progressive stages of the evolution of the concrete from the abstract, by terms of which the “Mineral, Vegetable, Animal Monad,” etc., are examples. The term merely means that the tidal wave of spiritual evolution is passing through that arc of its circuit. The “Monadic Essence” begins to imperceptibly differentiate towards individual consciousness in the vegetable kingdom. As the Monads are uncompounded things, as correctly defined by Leibnitz, it is the Spiritual Essence which vivifies them in their degrees of differentiation, which properly constitutes the Monad—not the atomic aggregation, which is only the vehicle and the substance through which thrill the lower and the higher degrees of intelligence.

>"Those who believe in Karma have to believe in destiny, which, from birth to death, every man is weaving, thread by thread, around himself, as a spider does his cobweb, and this destiny is guided either by the heavenly voice of the invisible prototype outside of us, or by our more intimate astral or inner man, who is but too often the evil genius of the embodied entity called man. Both these lead on the outward man, but one of them must prevail; and from the very beginning of the invisible affray the stern and implacable law of compensation steps in and takes its course, faithfully following the fluctuations. When the last strand is woven, and man is seemingly enwrapped in the network of his own doing, then he finds himself completely under the empire of this self-made destiny. . . . An Occultist or a philosopher will not speak of the goodness or cruelty of Providence; but, identifying it with Karma-Nemesis, he will teach that, nevertheless, it guards the good and watches over them in this as in future lives; and that it punishes the evil-doer — aye, even to his seventh re-birth — so long, in short, as the effect of his having thrown into perturbation even the smallest atom in the infinite world of harmony has not been finally re-adjusted. For the only decree of Karma — an eternal and immutable decree — is absolute harmony in the world of matter as it is in the world of spirit. It is not, therefore, Karma that rewards or punishes, but it is we who reward or punish ourselves according to whether we work with, through and along with nature, abiding by the laws on which that harmony depends, or — break them. Nor would the ways of Karma be inscrutable were men to work in union and harmony, instead of disunion and strife. For our ignorance of those ways — which one portion of mankind calls the ways of Providence, dark and intricate; while another sees in them the action of blind fatalism; and a third simple chance, with neither gods nor devils to guide them — would surely disappear if we would but attribute all these to their correct cause. . . . We stand bewildered before the mystery of our own making and the riddles of life that we will not solve, and then accuse the great Sphinx of devouring us. But verily there is not an accident of our lives, not a misshapen day, or a misfortune, that could not be traced back to our own doings in this or in another life. . . . . The law of Karma is inextricably interwoven with that of reincarnation. . . . . It is only this doctrine that can explain to us the mysterious problem of good and evil, and reconcile man to the terrible and apparent injustice of life. Nothing but such certainty can quiet our revolted sense of justice. For, when one unacquainted with the noble doctrine looks around him and observes the inequalities of birth and fortune, of intellect and capacities; when one sees honour paid to fools and profligates, on whom fortune has heaped her favours by mere privilege of birth, and their nearest neighbour, with all his intellect and noble virtues — far more deserving in every way — perishing for want and for lack of sympathy — when one sees all this and has to turn away, helpless to relieve the undeserved suffering, one's ears ringing and heart aching with the cries of pain around him — that blessed knowledge of Karma alone prevents him from cursing life and men as well as their supposed Creator. . . . . This law, whether conscious or unconscious, predestines nothing and no one. It exists from and in eternity truly, for it is eternity itself; and as such, since no act can be coequal with eternity, it cannot be said to act, for it is action itself. It is not the wave which drowns the man, but the personal action of the wretch who goes deliberately and places himself under the impersonal action of the laws that govern the ocean's motion. Karma creates nothing, nor does it design. It is man who plants and creates causes, and Karmic law adjusts the effects, which adjustment is not an act but universal harmony, tending ever to resume its original position, like a bough, which, bent down too forcibly, rebounds with corresponding vigour. If it happen to dislocate the arm that tried to bend it out of its natural position, shall we say it is the bough which broke our arm or that our own folly has brought us to grief? Karma has never sought to destroy intellectual and individual liberty, like the god invented by the Monotheists. It has not involved its decrees in darkness purposely to perplex man, nor shall it punish him who dares to scrutinize its mysteries. On the contrary, he who unveils through study and meditation its intricate paths, and throws light on those dark ways, in the windings of which so many men perish owing to their ignorance of the labyrinth of life, is working for the good of his fellow-men. Karma is an absolute and eternal law in the world of manifestation; and as there can only be one Absolute, as one Eternal, ever-present Cause, believers in Karma cannot be regarded as atheists or materialists, still less as fatalists, for Karma is one with the Unknowable, of which it is an aspect, in its effects in the phenomenal world."

>Elementary particles are vital forces, not acting mechanically, but from an internal principle. They are incorporeal spiritual units [“substantial,” however, but not “immaterial” in our sense] inaccessible to all change from without ... [and] indestructible by any external force. Leibnitz’ monads differ from atoms in the following particulars, which are very important for us to remember, otherwise we shall not be able to see the difference between Elementals and mere matter. Atoms are not distinguished from each other, they are qualitatively alike; but one monad differs from every other monad qualitatively; and every one is a peculiar world to itself. Not so with the atoms; they are absolutely alike quantitatively and qualitatively, and possess no individuality of their own. Again, the atoms [molecules, rather] of materialistic philosophy can be considered as extended and divisible, while the monads are mere “metaphysical points” and indivisible. Finally, and this is a point where these monads of Leibnitz closely resemble the Elementals of mystic philosophy, these monads are representative beings. Every monad reflects every other. Every monad is a living mirror of the Universe within its own sphere. And mark this, for upon it depends the power possessed by these monads, and upon it depends the work they can do for us; in mirroring the world, the monads are not mere passive reflective agents, but spontaneously self active; they produce the images spontaneously, as the soul does a dream. In every monad, therefore, the adept may read everything, even the future. Every monad—or Elemental—is a looking‐glass that can speak.

>The human race advances through the progress of individuals, who gradually become enlightened. When they constitute a majority, they take the lead and draw the rest forward. Persons of genius sporadically emerge and give momentum to advancement, and persons of authority, God’s instruments, carry out in the course of a few years what the race, left to its own devices, would have taken several centuries to accomplish.The progress of nations further highlights the justice of reincarnation. Through the efforts of moral individuals, a nation advances intellectually and morally, and is ultimately happier in this world and in the next. However, during its slow journey over the course of successive centuries, thousands of individuals die every day. What is the fate of those who have fallen along the way? Does their relative inferiority deprive them of the happiness reserved for future generations? Is their happiness relative? Divine justice cannot permit such an injustice. Through experiencing many lives, the right to happiness is within the reach of all the legacy of progress does not exclude anyone. Those who have lived during barbaric times can come back in a period of civilization in the same nation or another, and can profit by the advancement of the various nations on Earth.However, the concept of one life presents another difficulty. According to that theory, the soul is created at birth. For some individuals to be more advanced than others, God would have to create souls for them that are more advanced than the rest of creation. What would be the source of this favoritism? How can one person, who has lived no longer than another, often not even as long, merit a superior soul? That is not the only problem. A nation, over the course of a thousand years, transitions from barbarism to civilization. If all human beings lived one thousand years, we could understand that they would have the time to progress. However, many die every day, at all ages, and people are continuously being reborn on Earth. At the end of one thousand years, no trace remains of those who were living in a country one thousand years before. The nation has become civilized – but who has progressed? Are they the people who were once barbarians? But they died a long time ago. Are they the newcomers? If the soul is created at birth, these souls did not exist during the period of barbarism, and we would be required to assert that the efforts made to civilize a nation do not have the power to improve imperfect souls, but to make God create more perfect souls.We will now compare this theory of progress with that given by the spirits. The souls that come to a civilized nation have had their infancy, like all others, but they have already lived and are advanced due to prior progress. They are attracted by the circumstances best suited to them and their present condition. The efforts to civilize a nation are not aimed at creating better quality souls in the future, but rather, at attracting souls that have already progressed, regardless of where they have previously lived. The progress each nation accomplishes provides the key to the progress of humankind as a whole. It shows that when every nation on the Earth has reached the same level of moral advancement, our planet will be a haven of good spirits, who will live in a fraternal union. All the bad spirits will be repelled and forced to seek surroundings that suit them in inferior worlds, until they are worthy of coming back into our transformed world. The commonly accepted theory of the one life, devoid of the concept of reincarnation, leads to another consequence, specifically, that the work of social betterment is only beneficial to present and future generations. Its result is null and void for past generations, who made the mistake of entering the world too soon, and who have to make do, hampered by the faults of their barbaric past. According to Spiritism, the progress accomplished by later generations is also beneficial to the generations that preceded them, who can improve for the goal of civilization when they reincarnate at a point in the future. (See no. 222.)

>The progress of humanity results from the practical application of the laws of justice, love and charity. These laws are founded on the certainty of a future life. If we eliminate this certainty, we remove the cornerstone. These laws are the basis for all others, as they comprise all the conditions of human happiness. They alone can cure the plagues of society, and we may judge, by comparing the various ages and populations of the Earth, the improvement that takes place in the conditions of social life, as these laws are better understood and better carried out. If even just a partial and incomplete application of these laws manages to produce a noticeable improvement, imagine what it will be like when they become the basis for all social institutions! Could this be possible? Yes, because as human beings take ten steps forward, it is clear that they can take twenty, and so on. In that vein, the future can be inferred from the past. We see that the hostilities between different nations begin to soften, the barriers that separate them are toppled by civilization, and people are joining hands from one end of the world to the other. A larger measure of justice governs international laws. Wars occur less frequently and do not exclude humane feelings and attitudes. Consistency is established gradually in relationships, while the distinctions of races and classes are erased. People of different religious beliefs eventually set aside their preconceived notions so that they may unite with one another in worshiping one God. We are talking about the nations that are at the forefront of civilization (see nos. 789-793). In all these relations, we are still far from perfection. There are still many ruins to be torn down before the last vestiges of barbarism are cleared away, but can those ruins withstand the relentless action of progress, which, in itself is a law of nature? If the present generation is more advanced than the last, why shouldn’t the next be even more advanced than ours? This will always be the case by the force of circumstances. First, as each generation passes away it takes supporters of old injustices and abuses with it. Therefore, society is gradually rebuilt with new members who have thrown aside antiquated prejudices. Second, when people want progress, they study the obstacles that impede it and focus on the means for removing them. The progressive movement of human society is irrefutable, therefore progress undoubtedly continues in the future. It is in the nature of human beings to want to be happy. We want progress to increase our happiness, otherwise progress has no purpose. Where would we be if progress did not improve our position? When we obtain all the gratification that we can attain through intellectual progress, we realize that we have not obtained complete happiness, and that this happiness is impossible without having security in relationships. We can only obtain this security through moral progress. Thus, by the force of circumstances, we will work tirelessly for that end, and Spiritism will offer us the most effective means of reaching that goal.
## 6: Blavatsky (1888) 737 [0]

>Had Genesis begun as it ought, one would have found in it, first, the Celestial Logos, the “Heavenly Man,” which evolves as a Compound Unit of Logoi, out of which, after their pralayic sleep—a sleep that gathers the Numbers scattered on the mâyâvic plane into One, as the separate globules of quicksilver on a plate blend into one mass—the Logoi appear in their totality as the first “Male and Female,” or Adam Kadmon, the “Fiat Lux” of the Bible, as we have already seen. But this transformation did not take place on our Earth, nor on any material plane, but in the Spacial Depths of the first differentiation of the eternal Root‐Matter. On our nascent Globe, things proceed differently. The Monad or Jîva, as said in Isis Unveiled, is, first of all, shot down by the Law of Evolution into the lowest form of matter—the mineral. After a sevenfold gyration encased in the stone, or that which will become mineral and stone in the Fourth Round, it creeps out of it, say, as a lichen. Passing thence, through all the forms of vegetable matter, into what is termed animal matter, it has now reached the point at which it has become the germ, so to speak, of the animal, that will become the physical man. All this, up to the Third Round, is formless, as matter, and senseless, as consciousness. For the Monad, or Jîva, per se, cannot be called even Spirit: it is a Ray, a Breath of the Absolute, or the ABSOLUTENESS rather; and the Absolute Homogeneity, having no relations with the conditioned and relative finiteness, is unconscious on our plane. Therefore, besides the material which will be needed for its future human form, the Monad requires (a) a spiritual model, or prototype, for that material to shape itself into; and (b) an intelligent consciousness, to guide its evolution and progress, neither of which is possessed by the homogeneous Monad, or by senseless though living matter. The Adam of dust requires the Soul of Life to be breathed into him: the two middle Principles, which are the sentient Life of the irrational animal and the Human Soul, for the former is irrational without the latter. It is only when, from a potential androgyne, man has become separated into male and female, that he will be endowed with this conscious, rational, individual Soul (Manas), “the principle, or the intelligence, of the Elohim,” to receive which, he has to eat of the fruit of Knowledge from the Tree of Good and Evil. How is he to obtain all this? The Occult Doctrine teaches that while the Monad is cycling on downward into matter, these very Elohim, or Pitris—the lower Dhyân Chohans—are evolving, pari passu with it, on a higher and more spiritual plane, descending also relatively into matter, on their own plane of consciousness, when, after having reached a certain point, they will meet the incarnating senseless Monad, encased in the lowest matter, and blending the two potencies, Spirit and Matter, the union will produce that terrestrial symbol of the “Heavenly Man” in space—PERFECT MAN. In the Sânkhya Philosophy, Purusha (Spirit) is spoken of as something impotent unless it mounts on the shoulders of Prakriti (Matter), which, left alone, is—senseless. But in the Secret Philosophy they are viewed as graduated. Spirit and Matter, though one and the same thing in their origin, when once they are on the plane of differentiation, begin each of them their evolutionary progress in contrary directions—Spirit falling gradually into Matter, and the latter ascending to its original condition, that of a pure spiritual Substance. Both are inseparable, yet ever separated. On the physical plane, two like poles will always repel each other, while the negative and the positive are mutually attracted; so do Spirit and Matter stand to each other—the two poles of the same homogeneous Substance, the Root‐Principle of the Universe.
## 7: Blavatsky (1889) 349 [0]

>. . . "The human soul, once launched on the streams of evolution as a human individuality, (6) passes through alternate periods of physical and relatively spiritual existence. It passes from the one plane, or stratum, or condition of nature to the other under the guidance of its Karmic affinities; living in incarnations the life which its Karma has pre-ordained; modifying its progress within the limitations of circumstances, and, — developing fresh Karma by its use or abuse of opportunities, — it returns to spiritual existence (Devachan) after each physical life, — through the intervening region of Kamaloca — for rest and refreshment and for the gradual absorption into its essence, as so much cosmic progress, of the life's experience gained "on earth" or during physical existence. This view of the matter will, moreover, have suggested many collateral inferences to anyone thinking over the subject; for instance, that the transfer of consciousness from the Kamaloka to the Devachanic stage of this progression would necessarily be gradual (7); that in truth, no hard-and-fast line separates the varieties of spiritual conditions, that even the spiritual and physical planes, as psychic faculties in living people show, are not so hopelessly walled off from one another as materialistic theories would suggest; that all states of nature are all around us simultaneously, and appeal to different perceptive faculties; and so on. . . . It is clear that during physical existence people who possess psychic faculties remain in connection with the planes of superphysical consciousness; and although most people may not be endowed with such faculties, we all, as the phenomena of sleep, even, and especially . . . those of somnambulism or mesmerism, show, are capable of entering into conditions of consciousness that the five physical senses have nothing to do with. We — the souls within us — are not as it were altogether adrift in the ocean of matter. We clearly retain some surviving interest or rights in the shore from which, for a time, we have floated off. The process of incarnation, therefore, is not fully described when we speak of an alternate existence on the physical and spiritual planes, and thus picture the soul as a complete entity slipping entirely from the one state of existence to the other. The more correct definitions of the process would probably represent incarnation as taking place on this physical plane of nature by reason of an efflux emanating from the soul. The Spiritual realm would all the while be the proper habitat of the Soul, which would never entirely quit it; and that non-materializable portion of the Soul which abides permanently on the spiritual plane may fitly, perhaps, be spoken of as the HIGHER SELF."

>To make things plainer, without touching upon the mathematical aspects of the doctrine, the teaching given may be expanded and some obscure points solved. As the evolution of the Globes and that of the Monads are so closely interblended, we will make of the two teachings one. In reference to the Monads, the reader is asked to bear in mind that Eastern philosophy rejects the Western theological dogma of a newly‐created soul for every baby born, a dogma as unphilosophical as it is impossible in the economy of Nature. There must be a limited number of Monads, evolving and growing more and more perfect, through their assimilation of many successive Personalities, in every new Manvantara. This is absolutely necessary in view of the doctrines of Rebirth and Karma, and of the gradual return of the human Monad to its source—Absolute Deity. Thus, although the hosts of more or less progressed Monads are almost incalculable, they are still finite, as is everything in this Universe of differentiation and finiteness.
## 9: Blavatsky (1888) 502 [0]

>Further, when Globe A of the new Chain is ready, the first Class or Hierarchy of Monads from the Lunar Chain incarnate upon it in the lowest kingdom, and so on successively. The result of this is, that it is only the first Class of Monads which attains the human state of development during the first Round, since the second Class, on each Globe, arriving later, has not time to reach that stage. Thus the Monads of Class 2 reach the incipient human stage only in the Second Round, and so on up to the middle of the Fourth Round. But at this point—and on this Fourth Round in which the human stage will be fully developed—the “door” into the human kingdom closes; and henceforward the number of “human” Monads, i.e., Monads in the human stage of development, is complete. For the Monads which had not reached the human stage by this point, will, owing to the evolution of Humanity itself, find themselves so far behind, that they will reach the human stage only at the close of the Seventh and last Round. They will, therefore, not be men on this Chain, but will form the Humanity of a future Manvantara, and be rewarded by becoming “men” on a higher Chain altogether, thus receiving their Karmic compensation. To this there is but one solitary exception, and for very good reasons, of which we shall speak farther on. But this accounts for the difference in the Races.
## 10: Blavatsky (1888) 509 [0]

>The same difficulty of language is met with in describing the “stages” through which the Monad passes. Metaphysically speaking, it is of course an absurdity to talk of the “development” of a Monad, or to say that it becomes “man.” But any attempt to preserve metaphysical accuracy of language, in the use of such a tongue as the English, would necessitate at least three extra volumes of this work, and would entail an amount of verbal repetition which would be wearisome in the extreme. It stands to reason that a Monad cannot either progress or develop, or even be affected by the changes of state it passes through. It is not of this world or plane, and may only be compared to an indestructible star of divine light and fire, thrown down on to our Earth, as a plank of salvation for the Personalities in which it indwells. It is for the latter to cling to it; and thus partaking of its divine nature, obtain immortality. Left to itself the Monad will cling to no one; but, like the plank, be drifted away to another incarnation, by the unresting current of evolution.
## 11: Blavatsky (1888) 511 [0]

>The Monad emerges from its state of spiritual and intellectual unconsciousness; and, skipping the first two planes—too near the Absolute to permit of any correlation with anything on a lower plane—it gets directly into the plane of Mentality. But there is no plane in the whole universe with a broader margin, or a wider field of action, in its almost endless gradations of perceptive and apperceptive qualities, than this plane, which has in its turn an appropriate smaller plane for every “form,” from the Mineral Monad up to the time when that Monad blossoms forth by evolution into the Divine Monad. But all the time it is still one and the same Monad, differing only in its incarnations, throughout its ever succeeding cycles of partial or total obscuration of spirit, or partial or total obscuration of matter—two polar antitheses—as it ascends into the realms of mental spirituality, or descends into the depths of materiality.
## 12: Blavatsky (1888) 1941 [0]

>They say that what is called collectively Monads by Leibnitz—roughly viewed, and leaving every subdivision out of calculation, for the present—may be separated into three distinct Hosts, which, counted from the highest planes, are, firstly, “Gods,” or conscious, spiritual Egos; the intelligent Architects, who work after the plan in the Divine Mind. Then come the Elementals, or “Monads,” who form collectively and unconsciously the grand Universal Mirrors of everything connected with their respective realms. Lastly, the “Atoms,” or material molecules, which are informed in their turn by their “perceptive” Monads, just as every cell in a human body is so informed. There are shoals of such informed Atoms which, in their turn, inform the molecules; an infinitude of Monads, or Elementals proper, and countless spiritual Forces—Monadless, for they are pure incorporealities, except under certain laws, when they assume a form—not necessarily human. Whence the substance that clothes them—the apparent organism they evolve around their centres? The Formless (Arûpa) Radiations, existing in the harmony of Universal Will, and being what we term the collective or the aggregate of Cosmic Will on the plane of the subjective Universe, unite together an infinitude of Monads—each the mirror of its own Universe—and thus individualize for the time being an independent Mind, omniscient and universal; and by the same process of magnetic aggregation they create for themselves objective, visible bodies, out of the interstellar Atoms. For Atoms and Monads, associated or dissociated, simple or complex, are, from the moment of the first differentiation, but the “principles,” corporeal, psychic and spiritual, of the “Gods”—themselves the Radiations of Primordial Nature. Thus, to the eye of the Seer, the higher Planetary Powers appear under two aspects: the subjective—as influences, and the objective—as mystic forms, which, under Karmic law, become a Presence, Spirit and Matter being One, as repeatedly stated. Spirit is Matter on the seventh plane; Matter is Spirit at the lowest point of its cyclic activity; and both are—Mâyâ.
## 13: Blavatsky (1888) 2321 [0]

>1089 Leibnitz was an absolute Idealist in maintaining that “material atoms are contrary to reason.” (Système Nouveau, Erdmann, p. 126, col. 2.) For him Matter was a simple representation of the Monad, whether human or atomic. Monads, he thought (as do we), are everywhere. Thus the human soul is a Monad, and every cell in the human body has its Monad, as has every cell in animal, vegetable, and even in the so‐called inorganic bodies. His Atoms are the molecules of modern Science, and his Monads those simple atoms that Materialistic Science takes on faith, though it will never succeed in interviewing them—except in imagination. But Leibnitz is rather contradictory in his views about Monads. He speaks of his “Metaphysical Points” and “Formal Atoms,” at one time as realities, occupying space; at another as pure spiritual ideas; then he again endows them with objectivity and aggregates and positions in their co‐relations.

>"Every individual is making Karma either good or bad in each action and thought of his daily round, and is at the same time working out in this life the Karma brought about by the acts and desires of the last. When we see people afflicted by congenital ailments it may be safely assumed that these ailments are the inevitable results of causes started by themselves in a previous birth. It may be argued that, as these afflictions are hereditary, they can have nothing to do with a past incarnation; but it must be remembered that the Ego, the real man, the individuality, has no spiritual origin in the parentage by which it is re-embodied, but it is drawn by the affinities which its previous mode of life attracted round it into the current that carries it, when the time comes for re-birth, to the home best fitted for the development of those tendencies. . . . . This doctrine of Karma, when properly understood, is well calculated to guide and assist those who realize its truth to a higher and better mode of life, for it must not be forgotten that not only our actions but our thoughts also are most assuredly followed by a crowd of circumstances that will influence for good or for evil our own future, and, what is still more important, the future of many of our fellow-creatures. If sins of omission and commission could in any case be only self-regarding, the fact on the sinner's Karma would be a matter of minor consequence. The effect that every thought and act through life carries with it for good or evil a corresponding influence on other members of the human family renders a strict sense of justice, morality, and unselfishness so necessary to future happiness or progress. A crime once committed, an evil thought sent out from the mind, are past recall — no amount of repentance can wipe out their results in the future. Repentance, if sincere, will deter a man from repeating errors; it cannot save him or others from the effects of those already produced, which will most unerringly overtake him either in this life or in the next re-birth."
## 15: Davis (1847) 53 [0]

>The progress of light and knowledge in the world, will develop the true relation between nature and science and science and Man. Man's course is onward. Thought is like a great ocean whose tide is continually rising, but unlike the waters of earth, it will not again ebb. Truth is one vast Mountain, lifting its head with exalted dignity. It stands unmoved, and will not bow to the caprices of man; yet man will progress until he reaches its very heights. Ignorance and error cannot remove its foundation, nor prevent the progress of mental and moral attainment. Xerxes, marching with his mighty army to invade Greece, and being obstructed in his progress by the lofty Mount Athos —with the assumed pomp of ignorance and self-sufficiency, and feeling that he possessed all power, raised his hand and commanded it in imperious tones to give way and let him pass. He threatened its destruction if it did not quail at his voice: but finding it would not move, he commenced the tiresome work of perforating his way through it. But large and massive rocks obstructed his progress. And then his mighty bridge over the Hellespont became broken in pieces and destroyed. On seeing this, he commanded that by large stones and chains, the waves should be bound and repressed. But the waters heeded him not; but with a steady and fearless progress, ebbed and flowed as in derision of his feeble and prostrate powers. And so with the ocean of moral and intellectual progress. Urged by the great impetus, the love of truth, it will flow on until it subdues and overflows all that is of an opposite nature, and the world will be cleansed and renovated, and man will stand in the brightness and beauty of his nature. Then there will be diffused from this great source, a universal good, as constituting one Principle, one universal thought and action, one grand and lofty aspiration for perfection. Then all will compose ONE BODY — whose organs will reciprocally assist and promote the good of each other. And there will be no absorbents, no excrescences, no superfluous or imperfect parts. There will not be any individual or general wretchedness or distress; but all will act on the principles of their nature, as these will be set forth in the following Revelation.

>Two types of progress mutually support one another, but do not necessarily occur at the same rate: intellectual progress and moral progress. In civilized nations, the former is currently receiving a great deal of encouragement, and it has reached a degree of advancement that is incomparable to past ages. The second is very far from reaching the same point, although if we compare the social values across centuries, we are forced to admit that progress has also been made in this direction. Why has progress stalled in morality more than in intelligence? Why should there be less of a difference between the morality of the 19th and 24th centuries than between that of the 14th and the 19th? Not questioning the consistency of moral progress would be to assume either that the human race has reached the peak of perfection, which would be ridiculous, or that it is not morally perfectible, which experience contradicts.

>Philosophy in that day will be exact like mathematics, for true ideas—being those which are identical with the living order and so constituting the science of reality—shall combine with reason and justice to furnish exact proportions and equations as rigorous as numbers. Error thenceforth will be possible to ignorance alone, and true knowledge will be free from self-deception. Aestheticism will be subordinated no longer to caprices of taste which change as fashions change. If the beautiful is the splendour of the true, we shall be able to calculate without error the radiation of a light of which the source shall be certainly known and determined with exact precision. Poetry will abound no longer with foolish and subversive tendencies, nor will poets be those dangerous enchanters whom Plato crowned with flowers and banished from his republic; they will be rather magicians of reason and gracious mathematicians of harmony. Does this mean that the earth will become an Eldorado? No, for so long as humanity exists, there will be children, meaning those who are weak, small, ignorant and poor. But society will be governed by its true masters, and there will be no irremediable evil in human life. It will be understood that the divine miracles are those of eternal order, and the phantoms of imagination will be worshipped no longer on the faith of unexplained wonders. The abnormal character of certain phenomena is only a proof of our ignorance in the presence of the laws of Nature. When God designs to communicate the knowledge of Himself He enlightens our reason and does not seek to confound or surprise it. In that day we shall know the utmost limit of the power of man who is created in the image of God; we shall realise that he also is a creator in his own sphere and that his goodness, directed by Eternal Reason, is a lower providence for beings which are placed by Nature under his influence and domination. Religion will then and for evermore have nothing to fear from progress, and will follow in the course thereof. The Blessed Vincent de Lerins, a doctor justly venerated in the golden chain of catholicism, expresses admirably this accord between progress and conservative authority. According to him, true faith is worthy of our confidence only on account of that invariable authority which safeguards its dogmas from the caprices of human ignorance. “This notwithstanding,” adds Vincent de Lerins, “such immobility is not death; on the contrary, it preserves a germ of life for the future. That which we believe to-day without understanding will be understood by the future, which will rejoice in the knowledge thereof. _Posteritas intellectum gratuletur, quod ante vetustas non intellectum venerabatur._ If therefore we are asked whether all progress is excluded from the religion of Christ Jesus, the answer is no, assuredly, for great is the progress expected. Who indeed would be so jealous of humanity and at such enmity with God as to wish to hinder progress? But the condition is that it should be progress in reality, and not change of belief. Progress is the growth and development of each thing according to its class and its nature. Disorder is confusion and the medley of things and their nature. There must be undoubtedly a difference in the degrees of intelligence, science and wisdom, as much for men in general as for each man in particular, according to the natural succession of epochs in the Church, but so only that all be conserved and that dogma shall ever cherish the same spirit and maintain the same definition. Religion should develop souls successively, as life develops bodies which remain the same through all the stages of their growth. How great is the difference between the infantile flower of early years and the maturity of age. The old notwithstanding are the same in respect of personality as they were in boyhood; it is the exterior and the appearances which have changed. The limbs of an infant in the cradle are exceedingly frail, yet are they the same organs, having the same root principles, as those of the man; and this must be so, for otherwise there is deformity or death.

>But this “man” belongs to the Fourth Round. As shown, the Monad had passed through, journeyed and been imprisoned in, every transitional form, throughout every kingdom of nature, during the three preceding Rounds. But the Monad which becomes human, is not the Man. In this Round—with the exception of the highest mammals after man, the anthropoids destined to die out in this our race, when their Monads will be liberated and pass into the astral human forms, or the highest elementals, of the Sixth and the Seventh Races, and then into the lowest human forms in the Fifth Round—no units of any of the kingdoms are animated any longer by Monads destined to become human in their next stage, but only by the lower elementals of their respective realms. These “elementals” will become human Monads, in their turn, only at the next great planetary Manvantara.

>Nor did the “Hierogram within a Circle, or equilateral Triangle,” ever mean “the exemplification of the unity of the divine Essence”; for this was exemplified by the plane of the boundless Circle. What it really meant was the triune coëqual Nature of the first differentiated Substance, or the con‐substantiality of the (manifested) Spirit, Matter and the Universe—their “Son”—which proceeds from the Point, the real, Esoteric Logos, or Pythagorean Monad. For the Greek Monas signifies “Unity” in its primary sense. Those unable to seize the difference between the Monad—the Universal Unit—and the Monads or the manifested Unity, as also between the ever‐hidden and the revealed Logos, or the Word, ought never to meddle with Philosophy, let alone with the Esoteric Sciences. It is needless to remind the educated reader of Kant’s Thesis to demonstrate his second Antinomy. Those who have read and understood it will see clearly the line we draw between the absolutely ideal Universe and the invisible though manifested Kosmos. Our Gods and Monads are not the Elements of extension itself, but only those of the invisible Reality which is the basis of the manifested Kosmos. Neither Esoteric Philosophy, nor Kant, to say nothing of Leibnitz, would ever admit that extension can be composed of simple or unextended parts. But theologian‐philosophers will not grasp this. The Circle and the Point—the latter retiring into and merging with the former, after having emanated the first three Points and connected them with lines, thus forming the first noumenal basis of the Second Triangle in the Manifested World—have ever been an insuperable obstacle to theological flights into dogmatic empyreans. On the authority of this Archaic Symbol, a male, personal God, the Creator and Father of all, becomes a third‐rate emanation, the Sephira standing fourth in descent, and on the left hand of Ain Suph, in the Kabalistic Tree of Life. Hence, the Monad is degraded into a Vehicle—a “Throne”!

>δ17. Thus grosser matter, or rudimental beings, and their progression until they arrive at their ultimate perfection, are in correspondence with mind and its progress to its ultimate sphere. Their many spheres and associations are only such as mark the natural refinement or progression of all things. Intellectual progress commences in the body or first individualization: thence the mind goes onward through its many stages of knowledge, corresponding to the various stages of its ultimate progression.
