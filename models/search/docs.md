>‘The consciousness then seems to pass through the symbol to realms beyond it: probably visions and pictures from other planes come on to the hypersensitive brain centres. The sensation is as if looking at a series of moving pictures, and although there are beings with whom one can converse and animals one can dominate, there is no more solidity than in a cinema film. In time, however, the sensitivity of the brain increases, and one gains the power of actually going to the scenes of the visions and seeing them as three dimensional — indeed, one actually becomes capable of doing things in the vision and producing effects upon it. This is what is technically known as ‘Travelling in the Spirit Vision’ and whether it is more than an extension of the power of seeing the moving pictures on the Sphere of Sensation (the akashic envelope) is difficult to determine. The stages of Travelling in the Spirit Vision are as follows: —

>Whether it is more than an extension of the power of perceiving the pictures on the Sphere of Sensation or Akashic envelope is very difficult to determine. The sensation, however, to me personally is first to become, as it were, dimly conscious of a figure walking among the scenes of the new country — or the Astral Plane — gradually to become conscious that it is my own figure I am looking at — gradually, as it were, to be able to look through the eyes — and feel with the sensations of this doppel ganger. Further to be able consciously to direct its motions, to control it, to inhabit it, and in this body to be able to visit the scenes and persons I had previously only looked at, as it were, through a telescope.

>‘It is as though consciousness was extruded from one’s own body and taken over a body either created for the purpose or invoked out of the astral sphere. It seems probably that as the Sphere of Sensation reflects everything on the physical plane it contains a reflection of the material body of the percipient. If this is so it would follow that the body could be made to travel within the Sphere of Sensation and visit all things reflected therein.

>When a man has lived well the astral body evaporates like a pure incense ascending towards the upper regions ; but should he have lived in sin, his astral body, which holds him prisoner, still seeks the objects of its passions, and wishes to return to life. It torments the dreams of young girls, bathes in the steam of spilt blood, and floats about the places where the pleasures of its life elapsed ; it still watches over treasures which it possessed and buried; it expends itself in painful efforts to make fresh material organs and so live again. But the stars draw it up and absorb it ; its feels its intelligence weaken, its memory gradually vanishes, all its being dissolves. . . . Its former vices rise up before it, assume monstrous shapes, and pursue it ; they attack and devour it. ... The unfortunate creature thus successively loses all the members which have ministered to his iniquities ; then he dies a second time and for ever, because he loses his personality and his memory. Souls which are destined to live, but are not yet completely purified, remain captive for a longer or shorter period in the astral body, wherein they are burned by the odic light, which seeks to absorb and dissolve them. It is in order to escape from this body that suffering souls sometimes enter the bodies of the living and therein dwell in that state which Kabbalists term embryonic. Now, it is these aerial bodies which are evoked by necromancy. We enter into connection with larvae, with dead or perishing substances, by this operation. The beings in question, for the most part, cannot speak except by the tingling of our ears produced by the nervous shock to which I have referred, and commonly they can only reason by reflecting our thoughts and our reveries. To behold these strange forms, we must put ourselves in abnormal condition akin to sleep or death, in other words, we must magnetise ourselves and enter into a kind of lucid and waking somnambulism. Then necromancy has real results, and then the evocations of magic can produce actual visions. We have said that in the great magical agent, which is the astral light, there are preserved all impressions of things, all images formed either by rays or reflections ; in this same light our visions come to us, and it is this which intoxicates the insane, and leads away their dormant judgment in pursuit of the most bizarre phantoms. To insure vision without illusion in this light, a powerful will must be with us to isolate reflections and attract rays only. To dream awake is to see in the astral light, and the orgies of the Sabbath, described by so many sorcerers in their criminal trials, came to them solely in this manner. The preparations and the substances used to obtain this result were often horrible, as we shall see in the Ritual, but the result itself was never doubtful. They beheld, they heard, they handled the most abominable, most fantastic, most impossible things. We shall return to this subject in our fifteenth chapter ; at the present moment we are concerned only with the evocations of the dead.

>Let us pass to another maniac who was called Theophrastus Aureolus Bombast and was known in the World of Magic under the famous name of Paracelsus. There is no need to recapitulate what has been said concerning this master in our _Doctrine and Ritual of Transcendental Magic_, but something may be added on the occult medicine restored by Paracelsus. This truly universal medicine is based upon a spacious theory of light, called by adepts fluid or potable gold. Light, that creative agent, the vibrations of which are the movement and life of all things; light, latent in the universal ether, radiating about absorbing centres, which, being saturated thereby, project movement and life in their turn, so forming creative currents; light, astralised in the stars, animalised in animals, humanised in human beings; light, which vegetates in plants, glistens in metals, produces all forms of Nature and equilibrates all by the laws of universal sympathy—this is that light which exhibits the phenomena of magnetism, divined by Paracelsus, which tinctures the blood, being released from the air as it is inhaled and discharged by the hermetic bellows of the lungs. The blood then becomes a true elixir of life, wherein ruby and magnetic globules of vital light float in a slightly gilded fluid. These globules are actual seeds, ready to assume all forms of that world whereof the human body is an abridgment. They can become rarefied and coagulated, so renewing the humours which circulate in the nerves and in the flesh encompassing the bones. They radiate outside, or rather, in rarefying, they are drawn by the currents of light and circulate in the astral body—that interior and luminous body which is dilated by the imagination of ecstatics, so that their blood sometimes colours objects at a distance when these have been penetrated and identified with the astral body. In a special work on occult medicine that which is stated here will be proved, however strange and paradoxical it may seem at first sight to men of science. Such were the bases of medicine as put forward by Paracelsus; he cured by sympathy of light; he administered medicaments not to the outward material body, which is entirely passive, which can be rent and cut up without feeling anything when the astral body has withdrawn, but to the inward medium, to that vehicle which is the source of sensations. The quintessence of these he renewed by sympathetic quintessences. For example, he healed wounds by applying powerful reactives to the spilt blood, thus sending back its physical soul and purified sap to the body. To cure a diseased limb he made a limb of wax and, by will-power, transferred thereto the magnetism of the diseased limb. Then he treated the wax with vitriol, iron and fire, thus reacting by imagination and magnetic correspondence on the sick person himself, to whom the limb of wax had become an appendix and supplement. Paracelsus knew the mysteries of blood; he knew why the priests of Baal made incisions with knives in their flesh, and then brought down fire from heaven; he knew why orientals poured out their blood before a woman to inspire her with physical love; he knew how spilt blood cries for vengeance or mercy and fills the air with angels or demons. Blood is the instrument of dreams and multiplies images in the brain during sleep, because it is full of the Astral Light. Its globules are bisexual, magnetised and metalled, sympathetic and repelling. All forms and images in the world can be evoked from the physical soul or blood.

>Theo. In many ways. The causes of such manifestations are by no means so simple as the Spiritualists would like to believe. Foremost of all, the deus ex machina of the so-called "materializations" is usually the astral body or "double" of the medium or of some one present. This astral body is also the producer or operating force in the manifestations of slate-writing, "Davenport"-like manifestations, and so on.

>Then, maintaining your abstraction from your surroundings, and still concentrating upon the symbol and its correlated ideas, you are to seek a perception of a scene, panorama, or view of a place. This may also be brought on by a sense of tearing open, as a curtain is drawn aside and seeing the ‘within’ of the symbol before you. As the scene dawns upon you, particularise the details, and seek around for objects, and then for beings, entities and persons — attract their attention, call mentally to them by suitable titles and courtesies, and by proper and appropriate signs and symbols, such as the signs of the Grades, Pentagrams, etc. Test them by divine and angelic names, observing their attitude and responses thereto. Thus losing sight of the symbol, you see its inwardness, perceive things as in a mirror by Reflection. In this form of Descrying, note, that you see objects reversed, as to right and left, for which suitable allowance must be made. You project, in this process, part of your own nerve and spirit force upon the symbol, and by this you attract and attach to it more akashic force from the environment, hence the results obtained. If, instead of this Simple Spirit Vision, a ray of yourself is sent and actually goes to a place (astral projection) FLYING ROLL NO. XI

>Astral Projection, although from one point of thought a development of Clairvoyance, yet is from another distinct: in Astral Projection, the Adept emits from his Ego a perceptible ray of his identity, and by cultured and instructed Will, sends it to travel to the place desired, focusses it there, sees there — directly and not by reflection — perceives its bodily home, and re-enters it.
## 9: King (1987) 108 [2]

>If, then, everything in the Cosmos is somehow reflected or pictured on each man’s own sphere of sensation, or Akashic. envelope, it follows that if he could but be conscious of the pictures so reflected or imprinted he would at once be possessed of all actual or potential knowledge of everything in the Cosmos, and further assuming that time itself is merely an illusion, and that the reality of things is, as it were, one vast picture along which we travel seeing point after point in succession and producing the idea of lapse of time, then it further follows that the full and complete knowledge of all that is reflected in our sphere of sensation includes all knowledge past, present and future.
## 10: King (1987) 109 [2]

>The reason, then, why we have not such knowledge consciously to ourselves must be from the obtuseness of the Sensorium, the actual physical brain, which cannot perceive the images on the sphere of sensation. If, then, all knowledge lies ■within each man’s own sphere, it is by looking within, or intuition, that such knowledge is made available.
## 11: King (1987) 110 [2]

>Know thyself and thou wilt know everything. But seeing that the brain and sensorium are physical, it is necessary at first to use physical means to produce the sensitiveness necessary to consciously perceive the images on the Sphere of Sensation. And the readiest and safest means is the use of a symbol. This is familiar in everyday life, but so much so as to escape notice.
## 12: King (1987) 123 [2]

>It seems, however, almost more probable that as the Sphere of Sensation reflects everything that is in the material Universe so it must needs contain a reflection also of the material body of the percipient and if this be so it is not hard to suppose that such reflection can be made to travel about within the Sphere of Sensation and visit all things therein reflected with as much ease (or more) as the will of the man can make his physical body travel to material places on the earth.
## 13: King (1987) 195 [2]

>Secondly, as to the extension of our powers of perception beyond the plane of matter into the super-sensuous world, you must remember that the Theosophical view is the correct one and that our Thinking Personalities are incarnated into these material bodies and are acting therefore under the consequent disadvantages. It is because the mind is immersed in matter that its powers are so limited, and we can readily understand that a mind freed from constraints of the body would enjoy vastly enlarged powers. Thus, although our senses are the means by which we perceive; yet at the same time they necessarily limit the extent of our perception. It is therefore our material bodily organs which circumscribe as well as bestow. All of our five senses are capable of enlargement and development. It is however the sense of sight which we most commonly seek thus to develop. Having intellectually learned the laws which relate to sight and colour we are encouraged to practice Clairvoyance and to seek to see beyond material things into the plane most adjacent to us — the Astral, and then we seek to travel in the Spirit Vision through the confusions and the uncertainties of the Astral into the planes beyond.

>The Consciousness after death depends on the state of the Astral body here. In some cases it is weak and weary from its earthly pilgrimage here and requires a long sleep — in other cases it has periods of probation to undergo — or of purgation — but there are cases where the Astral enters at once on a career of help to those on earth — and to those also on its own astral plane.

>(c) The “Sea of Fire” is, then, the Super‐Astral (i.e., Noumenal) Light, the first radiation from the Root Mûlaprakriti, Undifferentiated Cosmic Substance, which becomes Astral Matter. It is also called the “Fiery Serpent,” as above described. If the student bears in mind that there is but One Universal Element, which is infinite, unborn, and undying and that all the rest—as in the world of phenomena—are but so many various differentiated aspects and transformations (correlations, they are now called) of that One, from macrocosmical down to microcosmical effects, from super‐human down to human and sub‐human beings, the totality, in short, of objective existence—then the first and chief difficulty will disappear and Occult Cosmology may be mastered. Thus in the Egyptian also as in the Indian Theogony there was a Concealed Deity, the ONE, and a creative, androgynous god; Shoo being the god of creation, and Osiris in his original primary form, the god “whose name is unknown.”

>“Thought is matter”: not of course, however, in the sense of the German Materialist Moleschott, who assures us that “thought is the movement of matter”—a statement of almost unparalleled absurdity. Mental states and bodily states are utterly contrasted as such. But that does not affect the position that every thought, in addition to its physical accompaniment (brain‐change), exhibits an objective—though to us supersensuously objective—aspect on the astral plane.

>“Lead the life necessary for the acquisition of such knowledge and powers, and Wisdom will come to you naturally. Whenever you are able to attune your consciousness to any of the seven chords of ‘Universal Consciousness,’ those chords that run along the sounding‐board of Kosmos, vibrating from one Eternity to another; when you have studied thoroughly the ‘Music of the Spheres,’ then only will you become quite free to share your knowledge with those with whom it is safe to do so. Meanwhile, be prudent. Do not give out the great Truths that are the inheritance of the future Races, to our present generation. Do not attempt to unveil the secret of Being and Non‐Being to those unable to see the hidden meaning of Apollo’s Heptachord, the lyre of the radiant god, in each of the seven strings of which dwelleth the Spirit, Soul and Astral Body of the Kosmos, whose shell only has now fallen into the hands of modern Science.... Be prudent, we say, prudent and wise, and above all take care what those who learn from you believe in; lest by deceiving themselves they deceive others, ... for such is the fate of every truth with which men are, as yet, unfamiliar.... Let rather the Planetary Chains and other super‐ and sub‐cosmic mysteries remain a dreamland for those who can neither see, nor yet believe that others can.”
# Astral Light

## 1: Levi (1856) 93 [7]

>Let us now state the manner in which visions operate. All forms correspond to ideas, and there is no idea which has not its proper and peculiar form. The primordial light, which is the vehicle of all ideas, is the mother of all forms, and transmits them from emanation to emanation, merely Diminished or modified according to the density of the media. Secondary forms are reflections which return to the font of the emanated light. The forms of objects, being a modification of light, remain in the light where the reflection consigns them. Hence the astral light, or terrestrial fluid, which we call the great magnetic agent, is saturated with all kinds of images or reflections. Now, our soul can evoke these, and refer them to its diaphane, as the kabbalists term it. Such images are always present to us, and are only effaced by the more powerful impressions of reality during waking hours, or by preoccupation of the mind, which makes our imagination inattentive to the fluidic panorama of the astral light. When we sleep, this spectacle presents itself spontaneously before us, and in this way dreams are produced dreams vague and incoherent if some governing will do not remain active during the sleep, giving, even unconsciously to our intelligence, a direction to the dream, which then transforms into vision. Animal magnetism is nothing else but an artificial sleep produced by the voluntary or enforced union of two wills, one of which is awake while the other slumbers that is, one of which directs the other in the choice of reflections for the transformation of dreams into visions, and the attainment of truth by means of images. Thus, somnambulists do not actually travel to the place where they are sent by the magnetiser ; they evoke its images in the astral light, and can behold nothing which does not exist in that light. The astral light has a direct action on the nerves, which are its conductors in the animal economy, transmitting it to the brain, whence also, in the state of somnambulism, it is possible to see by means of the nerves, without being dependent on radiant light, the astral fluid being a latent light, in the same way that physics recognise the existence of a latent caloric.

>I use the word ether in its general sense as meaning a very light, vaporous or gaseous matter; I use it, in short, as the astronomer uses it when he speaks of the ether of Space, by which he means a subtle but material medium.... When I speak of a nervous ether, I do not convey that the ether is existent in nervous structure only: I believe truly that it is a special part of the nervous organization; but, as nerves pass into all structures that have capacities for movement and sensibilities, so the nervous ether passes into all such parts; and as the nervous ether is, according to my view, a direct product from blood, so we may look upon it as a part of the atmosphere of the blood.... The evidence in favour of the existence of an elastic medium pervading the nervous matter and capable of being influenced by simple pressure is all- convincing.... In nervous structure there is, unquestionably, a true nervous fluid, as our predecessors taught. The precise chemical (?) composition of this fluid is not yet well known; the physical characters of it have been little studied. Whether it moves in currents, we do not know; whether it circulates, we do not know; whether it is formed in the centres and passes from them to the nerves, or whether it is formed everywhere where blood enters nerve, we do not know. The exact uses of the fluid we do not consequently know. It occurs to my mind, however, that the veritable fluid of nervous matter is not of itself sufficient to act as the subtle medium that connects the outer with the inner universe of man and animal. I think—and this is the modification I suggest to the older theory—there must be another form of matter present during life; a matter which exists in the condition of vapour or gas, which pervades the whole nervous organism, surrounds as an enveloping atmosphere each molecule of nervous structure, and is the medium of all motion, communicated to and from the nervous centres.... When it is once fairly presented to the mind that during life there is in the animal body a finely diffused form of matter, a vapour filling every part—and even stored in some parts; a matter constantly renewed by the vital chemistry; a matter as easily disposed of as the breath, after it has served its purpose—a new flood of light breaks on the intelligence.

>So far he is right enough. But when the great authority of the Western Kabalists adds that, nevertheless, “it is not the immortal Spirit, as the Indian Hierophants have imagined”—we answer, that he slanders the said Hierophants, as they have said nothing of the kind; for even the Purânic exoteric writings flatly contradict the assertion. No Hindû has ever mistaken Prakriti—the Astral Light being only above the lowest plane of Prakriti, the Material Kosmos—for the “immortal Spirit.” Prakriti is ever called Mâyâ, Illusion, and is doomed to disappear with the rest, the Gods included, at the hour of the Pralaya. As it is shown that Âkâsha is not even the Ether, least of all then, we imagine, can it be the Astral Light. Those unable to penetrate beyond the dead letter of the Purânas, have occasionally confused Âkâsha with Prakriti, with Ether, and even with the visible Sky! It is true also that those who have invariably translated the term Âkâsha by “Ether”—Wilson, for instance—finding it called “the material cause of sound” possessing, moreover, this one single property, have ignorantly imagined it to be “material,” in the physical sense. True, again, that if the characteristics are accepted literally, then, since nothing material or physical, and therefore conditioned and temporary, can be immortal—according to metaphysics and philosophy—it would follow that Âkâsha is neither infinite nor immortal. But all this is erroneous, since both the words Pradhâna, Primeval Matter, and Sound, as a property, have been misunderstood; the former term (Pradhâna) being certainly synonymous with Mûlaprakriti and Âkâsha, and the latter (Sound) with the Verbum, the Word or the Logos. This is easy to demonstrate; for it is shown in the following sentence from Vishnu Purâna. “There was neither day nor night, nor sky, nor earth, nor darkness, nor light, nor any other thing, save only One, unapprehensible by intellect, or that which is Brahman, and Pums, [Spirit] and Pradhâna [Primordial Matter].”

>Yet they all made a difference between the good and the bad Serpent (the Astral Light of the Kabalists)—between the former, the embodiment of divine Wisdom in the region of the Spiritual, and the latter, Evil, on the plane of Matter. For the Astral Light, or the Ether, of the ancient Pagans—the name Astral Light is quite modern—is Spirit‐Matter. Beginning with the pure spiritual plane, it becomes grosser as it descends, until it becomes Mâyâ, or the tempting and deceitful Serpent on our plane.

>The hypothesis of Metcalfe respecting sun‐force and earth‐force is not only very simple, but most fascinating.... Here are two elements in the universe, the one is ponderable matter.... The second element is the all‐pervading ether, solar fire. It is without weight, substance, form, or colour; it is matter infinitely divisible, and its particles repel each other; its rarity is such that we have no word, except ether, by which to express it. It pervades and fills space, but alone it too is quiescent—dead. We bring together the two elements, the inert matter, the self‐repulsive ether [?] and thereupon dead [?] ponderable matter is vivified; [Ponderable matter may be inert but never dead—this is Occult Law.] ... through the particles of the ponderable substance the ether [Ether’s second principle] penetrates, and, so penetrating, it combines with the ponderable particles and holds them in mass, holds them together in bond of union; they are dissolved in the ether.

>It is as platinum to hydrogen gas. Molecular separation of air brings us to the first sub‐division only; inter‐molecular, to the second; atomic, to the third; inter‐atomic, to the fourth; etheric, to the fifth; and inter‐etheric, to the sixth sub- division, or positive association with luminiferous ether. In my introductory argument I have contended that this is the vibratory envelope of all atoms. In my definition of atom I do not confine myself to the sixth sub‐division where this luminiferous ether is developed in its crude form, as far as my researches prove. I think this idea will be pronounced by the physicists of the present day, a wild freak of the imagination. Possibly, in time, a light may fall upon this theory that will bring its simplicity forward for scientific research. At present I can only compare it to some planet in a dark space, where the light of the sun of science has not yet reached it.... I assume that sound, like odour, is a real substance of unknown and wonderful tenuity, emanating from a body where it has been induced by percussion and throwing out absolute corpuscles of matter, inter‐atomic particles, with velocity of 1,120 feet per second; in vacuo 20,000. The substance which is thus disseminated is a part and parcel of the mass agitated, and, if kept under this agitation continuously, would, in the course of a certain cycle of time, become thoroughly absorbed by the atmosphere; or, more truly, would pass through the atmosphere to an elevated point of tenuity corresponding to the condition of sub‐division that governs its liberation from its parent body.... The sounds from vibratory forks, set so as to produce etheric chords, while disseminating their tones (compound), permeate most thoroughly all substances that come under the range of their atomic bombardment. The clapping of a bell in vacuo liberates these atoms with the same velocity and volume as one in the open air; and were the agitation of the bell kept up continuously for a few millions of centuries it would thoroughly return to its primitive element; and, if the chamber were hermetically sealed, and strong enough, the vacuous volume surrounding the bell would be brought to a pressure of many thousands of pounds to the square inch, by the tenuous substance evolved. In my estimation, sound truly defined is the disturbance of atomic equilibrium, rupturing actual atomic corpuscles; and the substance thus liberated must certainly be a certain order of etheric flow. Under these conditions, is it unreasonable to suppose that, if this flow were kept up, and the body thus robbed of its element, it would in time disappear entirely? All bodies are formed primitively from this highly tenuous ether, animal, vegetable, and mineral, and they are only returned to their high gaseous condition when brought under a state of differential equilibrium.... As regards odour, we can only get some definite idea of its extreme and wondrous tenuity by taking into consideration that a large area of atmosphere can be impregnated for a long series of years from a single grain of musk; which, if weighed after that long interval, will be found to be not appreciably diminished. The great paradox attending the flow of odorous particles is that they can be held under confinement in a glass vessel! Here is a substance of much higher tenuity than the glass that holds it, and yet it cannot escape. It is as a sieve with its meshes large enough to pass marbles, and yet holding fine sand which cannot pass through; in fact, a molecular vessel holding an atomic substance. This is a problem that would confound those who stop to recognize it. But infinitely tenuous as odour is, it holds a very crude relation to the substance of sub- division that governs a magnetic flow (a flow of sympathy, if you please to call it so). This sub‐division comes next to sound, but is above sound. The action of the flow of a magnet coincides somewhat to the receiving and distributing portion of the human brain, giving off at all times a depreciating ratio of the amount received. It is a grand illustration of the control of mind over matter, which gradually depreciates the physical till dissolution takes place. The magnet on the same ratio gradually loses its power and becomes inert. If the relations that exist between mind and matter could be equated and so held, we would live on in our physical state eternally, as there would be no physical depreciation. But this physical depreciation leads, at its terminus, to the source of a much higher development—viz., the liberation of the pure ether from the crude molecular; which, in my estimation, is to be much desired.

>Yetzirah is the Astral Light, which is especially the medium wherein operate the Ethers of the Elements under the presidency of the Planets: I use the expression Ether of the Elements in order to convey the significance of the Hermetic conception of the ‘Elements’. The Elements of the ancients (called respectively Fire, Water, Air and Earth) are not at all the physical Elements but the subtle Ethers underlying these, — the presence of which is necessary before the gross Elements can be manifested. Hence the Altar symbolism.

>Man is the microcosm or little world, ant centres the doctrine of analogies, whatsoever is in th is reproduced in the small. Hence we have of fluidic attraction and projection the brain, the heart or epigastric region, and the genital organ. Each of these instruments is double in other words, we find the suggestion of the triad therein. Each attracts on one side and repels on another. It is by means of these apparatuses that we place ourselves in communication with the universal fluid transmitted into us by the nervous system. These three centres are, moreover, the seat of the threefold magnetic operation, as we shall explain elsewhere. When the magus has attained lucidity, whether through the mediation of a pythoness, or by his own development, he communicates and directs at will the magnetic vibrations in the whole mass of the astral light, the currents of which he divines by means of the magic rod, which is a perfected divining rod. By the aid of these vibrations he influences the nervous system of persons surrendered to his action, accelerates or suspends the currents of life, soothes or tortures, heals or hurts ; in fine, slays or brings to life. . . . Here, however, we pause in presence of the smile of incredulity. Let us permit it to enjoy the cheap triumph of denying what it does not know. We shall demonstrate later on that death is always preceded by a lethargic sleep, and only takes place gradually ; that resurrection is possible in certain cases ; that lethargy is a real, but uncompleted, death ; and that the final paroxysm is in many cases subsequent to inhumation. This, however, is not the subject of the present chapter. We now affirm that a lucid will can act upon the mass of the astral light, and, in concurrence with other wills, which it absorbs and draws along, can determine great and irresistible currents. We say also that the astral light condenses or rarefies in proportion as currents accumulate, more or less, at certain centres. When it is deficient in the energy required for the support of life, diseases accompanied by sudden decomposition follow, of the kind which baffle physicians. There is no other cause, by example, in the case of cholera-morbus, and the swarms of animalcule observed or supposed by some specialists may be the effect rather than the cause. Cholera should therefore be treated by insufflation, did not the operator thereby run the chance of an exchange with the patient, which would be very formidable for himself. Every intelligent effort of will is a projection of the human fluid or light, and here it is needful to distinguish the human from the astral light, and animal from universal magnetism. In making use of the word fluid, we employ an accepted expression, and would make ourselves understood in this manner, but we are far from deciding that the latent light is a fluid. Everything prompts us, on the contrary, to prefer the system of vibrations in the explanation of this phenomenal subject. However it may be, the light in question, being the instrument of life, cleaves naturally to all living centres, attaches itself to the nucleus of planets, even as to the heart of man and by the heart we understand magically the great sympathetic identifying itself with the individual life of the being which it animates, and it is by this quality of sympathetic assimilation that it distributes itself without confusion. Hence it is terrestrial in its affinity with the sphere of the earth, and human exclusively in its affinity with men.

>The phenomena which have quite recently perturbed America and Europe, as regards table-turning and fluidic manifestations, are simply magnetic currents at the beginning of their formation, appeals on the part of nature inviting us, for the good of humanity, to re-establish the great sympathetic and religious chains. As a fact, stagnation in the astral light would mean death to the human race, and torpor in this secret agent has already been manifested by alarming symptoms of decomposition and death. For example, cholera-morbus, the potato disease, and the blight of the grape, are traceable solely to this cause, as the two young shepherds of la Salette saw darkly and symbolically in their dream. The unlooked-for credit which awaited their narrative, and the vast concourse of pilgrims attracted by a statement so singular and at the same time so vague as that of these two children without instruction and almost without morality, are proofs of the magnetic reality of the fact, and the fluidic tendency of the earth itself to operate the cure of its inhabitants. Superstitions are instinctive, and all that is instinctive is founded in the very nature of things, to which fact the sceptics of all times have given insufficient attention. We attribute, then, all the strange phenomena of table-turning to the universal magnetic agent in search of a chain of enthusiasms with a view to the formation of fresh currents. The force of itself is blind, but it can be directed by the will of man, and is influenced by prevailing opinions. This universal fluid if we decide to regard it as a fluid being the common medium of all nervous organisms, and the vehicle of all sensitive vibrations, establishes an actual physical solidarity between impressionable persons, and transmits from one to another the impressions of imagination and of thought. The movement of the inert object, determined by the undulations of the universal agent, obeys the ruling impression, and reproduces in its revelations at one time all the lucidity of the most wonderful visions, and at another all the eccentricity and falsehood of the most vague and incoherent dreams. The blows resounding on furniture, the clattering of dishes, the self -playing of musical instruments, are illusions produced by the same cause. The miracles of the convulsionaries of Saint Medard were of the same order, and seemed frequently to suspend the laws of nature. On the one hand, exaggeration produced by fascination, which is the special quality of intoxication occasioned by congestions of the astral light; on the other, actual oscillations or movements impressed upon inert matter by the subtle and universal agent of motion and life. Such is the sole foundation of these occurrences which look so marvellous, as we may easily demonstrate at will by reproducing, in accordance with rules laid down in the Ritual, the most astounding of these phenomena, establishing, as can be done quite simply, the absence of trickery, hallucination, or error.
## 10: Blavatsky (1888) 325 [3]

>There is a whole poem on the pregenetic battles fought by the growing planets before the final formation of Cosmos, thus accounting for the seemingly disturbed position of the systems of several planets; the plane of the satellites of some (of Neptune and Uranus, for instance, of which the ancients knew nothing, it is said) being tilted over, thus giving them an appearance of retrograde motion. These planets are called the Warriors, the Architects, and are accepted by the Roman Church as the leaders of the heavenly Hosts, thus showing the same traditions. Having evolved from Cosmic Space, the Sun, we are taught—before the final formation of the primaries and the annulation of the planetary nebulæ—drew into the depths of his mass all the cosmic vitality he could, threatening to engulf his weaker “Brothers,” before the law of attraction and repulsion was finally adjusted; after which, he began feeding on “the Mother’s refuse and sweat”; in other words, on those portions of Æther (the “Breath of the Universal Soul”), of the existence and constitution of which Science is as yet absolutely ignorant. As a theory of this kind has been propounded by Sir William Grove, who theorizes that the systems “are gradually changing by atmospheric additions or subtractions, or by accretions and diminutions arising from nebular substance,” and again that “the sun may condense gaseous matter as it travels in space, and so heat may be produced”—the archaic teaching seems scientific enough, even in this age. Mr. W. Mattieu Williams suggested that the diffused matter or Ether, which is the recipient of the heat radiations of the Universe, is thereby drawn into the depths of the solar mass; expelling thence the previously condensed and thermally exhausted Ether, it becomes compressed and gives up its heat, to be in turn itself driven out in a rarefied and cooled state, to absorb a fresh supply of heat, which he supposes to be in this way taken up by the Ether, and again concentrated and redistributed by the Suns of the Universe.

>Therefore, the elements of our planet cannot be taken as a standard for comparison with the elements in other worlds. In fact each world has its Fohat, which is omnipresent in its own sphere of action. But there are as many Fohats as there are worlds, each varying in power and degree of manifestation. The individual Fohats make one universal, collective Fohat—the aspect‐entity of the one absolute Non‐Entity, which is absolute Be‐ness, Sat. “Millions and billions of worlds are produced at every Manvantara”—it is said. Therefore there must be many Fohats, whom we consider as conscious and intelligent Forces. This, no doubt, to the disgust of scientific minds. Nevertheless the Occultists, who have good reasons for it, consider all the forces of Nature as veritable, though supersensuous, states of Matter; and as possible objects of perception to beings endowed with the requisite senses.

>In Volume II of the same work, the philosophical systems of the Gnostics and the primitive Jewish Christians, the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, are fully considered. They show the views held in those days, outside the circle of Mosaic Jews, about Jehovah. He was identified by all the Gnostics with the evil, rather than with the good principle. For them, he was Ilda‐Baoth, the “Son of Darkness,” whose mother, Sophia Achamôth, was the daughter of Sophia, the Divine Wisdom—the female Holy Ghost of the early Christians—Âkâsha; Sophia Achamôth personifying the Lower Astral Light or Ether. The Astral Light stands in the same relation to Âkâsha and Anima Mundi, as Satan stands to the Deity. They are one and the same thing seen from two aspects, the spiritual and the psychic—the super‐ethereal, or connecting link between matter and pure spirit—and the physical. Ilda‐Baoth—a compound name, made up of Ilda (ילד), child, and Baoth; the latter from בהוצ an egg, and בהות, chaos, emptiness, void, or desolation; or the Child born in the Egg of Chaos, like Brahmâ—or Jehovah, is simply one of the Elohim, the Seven Creative Spirits, and one of the lower Sephiroth. Ilda‐Baoth produces from himself seven other Gods, “Stellar Spirits,” or the Lunar Ancestors, for they are all the same. They are all in his own image, the “Spirits of the Face,” and the reflections one of the other, who become darker and more material, as they successively recede from their originator. They also inhabit seven regions disposed like a stair, for its steps mount and descend the scale of spirit and matter. With Pagans and Christians, with Hindûs and Chaldeans, with Greek as with Roman Catholics—the texts varying slightly in their interpretations—they all were the Genii of the seven planets, and of the seven planetary spheres of our septenary Chain, of which Earth is the lowest. This connects the “Stellar” and “Lunar” Spirits with the higher planetary Angels, and the Saptarshis, the Seven Rishis of the Stars, of the Hindûs—as subordinate Angels, or Messengers, to these Rishis, their emanations, on the descending scale. Such, in the opinion of the philosophical Gnostics, were the God and the Archangels now worshipped by the Christians! The “Fallen Angels” and the legend of the “War in Heaven” are thus purely pagan in their origin, and come from India, viá Persia and Chaldea. The only reference to them in the Christian canon is found in Revelation xii, as quoted a few pages back.

>The first after the One is Divine Fire; the second, Fire and Ether; the third is composed of Fire, Ether and Water; the fourth of Fire, Ether, Water, and Air. The One is not concerned with Man‐bearing Globes, but with the inner, invisible Spheres. The First‐Born are the LIFE, the Heart and Pulse of the Universe; the Second are its MIND or Consciousness.
## 14: Blavatsky (1888) 751 [3]

>Discussing and explaining the nature of the invisible Elements and the “Primordial Fire” mentioned above, Éliphas Lévi invariably calls it the “Astral Light”: with him it is the “Grand Agent Magique.” Undeniably it is so, but—only so far as Black Magic is concerned, and on the lowest planes of what we call Ether, the noumenon of which is Âkâsha; and even this would be held incorrect by orthodox Occultists. The “Astral Light” is simply the older “Sidereal Light” of Paracelsus; and to say that “everything which exists has been evolved from it, and it preserves and reproduces all forms,” as he does, is to enunciate truth only in the second proposition. The first is erroneous; for if all that exists was evolved through (or viâ) it, this is not the Astral Light, since the latter is not the container of all things but, at best, only the reflector of this all. Éliphas Lévi very truly shows it “a force in Nature,” by means of which “a single man who can master it ... might throw the world into confusion and transform its face”; for it is the “Great Arcanum of transcendent Magic.” Quoting the words of the great Western Kabalist in their translated form, we may, perhaps, the better explain them by the occasional addition of a word or two, to show the difference between Western and Eastern explanations of the same subject. The author says of the great Magic Agent:
## 15: Blavatsky (1888) 873 [3]

>The Astral Light of the Kabalists is by some very incorrectly translated “Ether,” the latter is confused with the hypothetical Ether of Science, and both are referred to by some Theosophists as synonymous with Âkâsha. This is a great mistake.
## 16: Blavatsky (1888) 875 [3]

>It is vacuity, no doubt, especially for Rationalists. At any rate Âkâsha is sure to produce vacuity in the brain of a Materialist. Nevertheless, though Âkâsha is certainly not the Ether of Science—not even the Ether of the Occultist who defines the latter as one of the principles of Âkâsha only—it is as certainly, together with its primary, the cause of sound, a psychical and spiritual, not a material cause by any means. The relations of Ether to Âkâsha may be defined by applying to both Âkâsha and Ether the words used of the God in the Vedas, “So himself was indeed (his own) son,” one being the progeny of the other and yet itself. This may be a difficult riddle to the profane, but very easy to understand for any Hindû—even though not a Mystic.
## 17: Blavatsky (1888) 977 [3]

>It thus becomes evident that it is not this Ether—sprung at the fourth remove from an emanation of “Intelligence, associated with Ignorance”—which is the high Principle, the deific Entity worshipped by the Greeks and Latins under the name of “Pater, Omnipotens Æther,” and “Magnus Æther,” in its collective aggregate. The septenary gradation, and the innumerable sub‐divisions and differences, made by the Ancients between the powers of Ether collectively—from its outward fringe of effects, with which our Science is so familiar, up to the “Imponderable Substance,” once admitted as the “Ether of Space,” but now about to be rejected—have been ever a vexing riddle for every branch of knowledge. The Mythologists and Symbologists of our day, confused by this incomprehensible glorification on the one hand, and degradation on the other, of the same deified Entity and in the same religious systems, are often driven to the most ludicrous mistakes. The Church, firm as a rock in each and all of her early errors of interpretation, has made of Ether the abode of her Satanic legions. The whole Hierarchy of the “Fallen” Angels is there; Cosmocratores, the “World Bearers,” according to Bossuet; Mundi Tenentes, the “World Holders,” as Tertullian calls them; Mundi Domini, “World Dominations,” or rather Dominators; the Curbati, or “Curved,” etc.; thus making of the stars and celestial orbs in their courses—Devils!
## 18: Blavatsky (1888) 1013 [3]

>Spirit, then, or Cosmic Ideation, and Cosmic Substance—one of whose “principles” is Ether—are one, and include the Elements, in the sense St. Paul attaches to them. These Elements are the veiled Synthesis standing for Dhyân Chohans, Devas, Sephiroth, Amshaspends, Archangels, etc. The Ether of Science—the Ilus of Berosus, or the Protyle of Chemistry—constitutes, so to speak, the rude material, relatively, out of which the above‐named Builders, following the plan traced out for them eternally in the Divine Thought, fashion the Systems in the Kosmos. They are “myths,” we are told. No more so than Ether and the Atoms, we answer. The two latter are absolute necessities of Physical Science, and the Builders are as absolute a necessity of Metaphysics. We are twitted with the objection: You never saw them. And we ask the Materialists: Have you ever seen Ether, or your Atoms, or, again, your Force? Moreover, one of the greatest Western Evolutionists of our modern day, co‐“discoverer” with Darwin, Mr. A. R. Wallace, when discussing the inadequacy of Natural Selection alone accounting for the physical form of Man, admits the guiding action of “higher intelligences” as a “necessary part of the great laws which govern the material Universe.”
## 19: Blavatsky (1888) 1024 [3]

>Chaos was called senseless by the Ancients, because—Chaos and Space being synonymous—it represented and contained in itself all the Elements in their rudimentary, undifferentiated State. They made Æther, the fifth Element, the synthesis of the other four; for the Æther of the Greek philosophers was not its Dregs, although indeed they knew more than Science does now of these Dregs (Ether), which are rightly enough supposed to act as an agent for many Forces that manifest on Earth. Their Æther was the Âkâsha of the Hindûs; the Ether accepted in Physics is but one of its sub‐divisions, on our plane, the Astral Light of the Kabalists with all its evil as well as its good effects.
## 20: Blavatsky (1888) 1447 [3]

>Stallo then points out the change caused by the kinetic theories; that from the date of the dynamical theory of heat, Ether was chosen in Optics as a substratum for luminous undulations. Next, in order to explain the dispersion and polarization of light, Physicists had to resort once more to their “scientific imagination,” and forthwith endowed the Ether with (a) atomic or molecular structure, and (b) with an enormous elasticity, “so that its resistance to deformation far exceeded that of the most rigid elastic bodies.” This necessitated the theory of the essential discontinuity of Matter, hence of Ether. After having accepted this discontinuity, in order to account for dispersion and polarization, theoretical impossibilities were discovered with regard to such dispersion. Cauchy’s “scientific imagination” saw in Atoms “material points without extension,” and he proposed, in order to obviate the most formidable obstacles to the undulatory theory (namely, some well‐known mechanical theorems which stood in the way), to assume that the ethereal medium of propagation, instead of being continuous, should consist of particles separated by sensible distances. Fresnel rendered the same service to the phenomena of polarization. E. B. Hunt upset the theories of both. There are now men of Science who proclaim them “materially fallacious,” while others—the “atomo‐mechanicalists”—cling to them with desperate tenacity. The supposition of an atomic or molecular constitution of Ether is upset, moreover, by thermo‐dynamics, for Clerk Maxwell showed that such a medium would be simply gas. The hypothesis of “finite intervals” is thus proven of no avail as a supplement to the undulatory theory. Besides, eclipses fail to reveal any such variation of colour as is supposed by Cauchy, on the assumption that the chromatic rays are propagated with different velocities. Astronomy has pointed out more than one phenomenon absolutely at variance with this doctrine.
# Kabbalistic Tarot

## 1: Levi (1856) 162 [1]

>In archaic writings preceding the Captivity, the Hebrew tau was cruciform, which further confirms our interpretation of the twelfth plate of the Kabbalistic Tarot. The cross, which produces four triangles, is also the sacred sign of the duodenary, and on this account it was called the Key of heaven by the Egyptians. So Etteilla, confused by his protracted researches for the conciliation of the analogical necessities of this symbol with his own personal opinion, in which he was influenced by the erudite Court de Gebelin, placed in the hand of his upright hanged man, by him interpreted as Prudence, a Hermetic caduceus, formed by two serpents and a Greek tau. Seeing that he understood the necessity for the tau or cross on the twelfth leaf of the book of Thoth, he should also have seen the multiple and magnificent meaning of the Hermetic hanged man, the Prometheus of science, the living man who makes contact with earth by his thought alone, whose firm ground is heaven, the free and immolated adept, the revealer menaced with death, the conjuration of Judaism against Christ, which seems to be an involuntary admission of the secret divinity of the Crucified, lastly, the sign of the work accomplished, the cycle terminated, the intermediary tau, which resumes for the first time, before the final denary, the signs of the sacred alphabet.

>The author—the writer, rather—feels it necessary to apologize for the long delay which has occurred in the appearance of this work. It has been occasioned by ill‐health and the magnitude of the undertaking. Even the two volumes now issued do not complete the scheme, nor do these treat exhaustively of the subjects dealt with in them. A large quantity of material has already been prepared, dealing with the history of Occultism as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of the Âryan Race, and showing the bearing of Occult Philosophy upon the conduct of life, as it is and as it ought to be. Should the present volumes meet with a favourable reception, no effort will be spared to carry out the scheme of the work in its entirety.
## 4: Blavatsky (1888) 3 [0]

>This scheme, it must be added, was not in contemplation when the preparation of the work was first announced. As originally announced, it was intended that The Secret Doctrine should be an amended and enlarged version of Isis Unveiled. It was, however, soon found that the explanations which could be added to those already put before the world, in the last‐named and other works dealing with Esoteric Science, were such as to require a different method of treatment; and consequently the present volumes do not contain, in all, twenty pages extracted from Isis Unveiled.

>The author does not feel it necessary to ask the indulgence of her readers and critics for the many defects of literary style, and the imperfect English which may be found in these pages. She is a foreigner, and her knowledge of the language was acquired late in life. The English tongue is employed because it offers the most widely‐diffused medium for conveying the truths which it had become her duty to place before the world.
## 6: Blavatsky (1888) 5 [0]

>These truths are in no sense put forward as a revelation; nor does the author claim the position of a revealer of mystic lore, now made public for the first time in the world’s history. For what is contained in this work is to be found scattered throughout thousands of volumes embodying the Scriptures of the great Asiatic and early European religions, hidden under glyph and symbol, and hitherto left unnoticed because of this veil. What is now attempted is to gather the oldest tenets together and to make of them one harmonious and unbroken whole. The sole advantage which the writer has over her predecessors, is that she need not resort to personal speculations and theories. For this work is a partial statement of what she herself has been taught by more advanced students, supplemented, in a few details only, by the results of her own study and observation. The publication of many of the facts herein stated has been rendered necessary by the wild and fanciful speculations in which many Theosophists and students of Mysticism have indulged, during the last few years, in their endeavour, as they imagined, to work out a complete system of thought from the few facts previously communicated to them.

>It is needless to explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine in its entirety, but a select number of fragments of its fundamental tenets, special attention being paid to some facts which have been seized upon by various writers, and distorted out of all resemblance to the truth.
## 8: Blavatsky (1888) 7 [0]

>But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings, however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in these volumes, do not belong to the Hindû, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldæan, or the Egyptian religion, nor to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or Christianity exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is the essence of all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the various religious schemes are now made to merge back into their original element, out of which every mystery and dogma has grown, developed, and become materialized.

>The writer, therefore, is fully prepared to take all the responsibility for what is contained in this work, and even to face the charge of having invented the whole of it. That it has many shortcomings she is fully aware; all that she claims for it is that, romantic as it may seem to many, its logical coherence and consistency entitle this new Genesis to rank, at any rate, on a level with the “working hypotheses” so freely accepted by Modern Science. Further, it claims consideration, not by reason of any appeal to dogmatic authority, but because it closely adheres to Nature, and follows the laws of uniformity and analogy.
## 11: Blavatsky (1888) 10 [0]

>The aim of this work may be thus stated: to show that Nature is not “a fortuitous concurrence of atoms,” and to assign to man his rightful place in the scheme of the Universe; to rescue from degradation the archaic truths which are the basis of all religions; to uncover, to some extent, the fundamental unity from which they all spring; finally, to show that the Occult side of Nature has never been approached by the Science of modern civilization.

>If this is in any degree accomplished, the writer is content. It is written in the service of humanity, and by humanity and the future generations it must be judged.

That this is not done is one of the many minor losses caused by the one great loss.

>Awkward phrases, due to imperfect knowledge of English, have been corrected; most of the quotations have been verified, and exact references given—a work involving great labour, as the references in the previous editions were often very loose; a uniform system of transliteration for Sanskrit words has been adopted. Rejecting the form most favoured by Western Orientalists as being misleading to the general reader—we have given to the consonants not present in our English alphabet combinations that approximately express their sound‐values, and we have carefully inserted quantities, wherever they occur, on the vowels. In a few instances we have incorporated notes in the text, but this has been very sparingly done, and only when they obviously formed part of it.

>Since the appearance of Theosophical literature in England, it has become customary to call its teachings “Esoteric Buddhism.” And, having become a habit—as an old proverb based on daily experience has it—“Error runs down an inclined plane, while Truth has to laboriously climb its way up hill.”
## 17: Blavatsky (1888) 16 [0]

>Old truisms are often the wisest. The human mind can hardly remain entirely free from bias, and decisive opinions are often formed before a thorough examination of a subject from all its aspects has been made. This is said with reference to the prevailing double mistake (a) of limiting Theosophy to Buddhism; and (b) of confounding the tenets of the religious philosophy preached by Gautama, the Buddha, with the doctrines broadly outlined in Esoteric Buddhism. Any thing more erroneous than this could hardly be imagined. It has enabled our enemies to find an effective weapon against Theosophy, because, as an eminent Pâli scholar very pointedly expressed it, there was in the volume named “neither Esotericism nor Buddhism.” The esoteric truths, presented in Mr. Sinnett’s work, ceased to be esoteric from the moment they were made public; nor did the book contain the religion of Buddha, but simply a few tenets from a hitherto hidden teaching, which are now explained and supplemented by many more in the present volumes. And even the latter, though giving out many fundamental tenets from the SECRET DOCTRINE of the East, raise but a small corner of the dark veil. For no one, not even the greatest living Adept, would be permitted to, or could—even if he would—give out promiscuously to a mocking, unbelieving world that which has been so effectually concealed from it for long æons and ages.
## 18: Blavatsky (1888) 17 [0]

>Esoteric Buddhism was an excellent work with a very unfortunate title, though it meant no more than does the title of this work, THE SECRET DOCTRINE. It proved unfortunate, because people are always in the habit of judging things by their appearance rather than by their meaning, and because the error has now become so universal, that even most of the Fellows of the Theosophical Society have fallen victims to the same misconception. From the first, however, protests were raised by Brâhmans and others against the title; and, in justice to myself, I must add that Esoteric Buddhism was presented to me as a completed volume, and that I was entirely unaware of the manner in which the author intended to spell the word “Budh‐ism.”
## 19: Blavatsky (1888) 18 [0]

>This has to be laid directly at the door of those who, having been the first to bring the subject under public notice, neglected to point out the difference between “Buddhism”—the religious system of ethics preached by the Lord Gautama, and so named from his title of Buddha, the “Enlightened”—and “Budhism,” from Budha, Wisdom, or Knowledge (Vidyâ), the faculty of cognizing, from the Sanskrit root Budh, to know. We Theosophists of India are ourselves the real culprits, although, at the time, we did our best to correct the mistake. To avoid this deplorable misnomer was easy; the spelling of the word had only to be altered, and by common consent both pronounced and written “Budhism,” instead of “Buddhism.” Nor is the latter term correctly spelt and pronounced, as it ought to be called, in English, Buddhaïsm, and its votaries “Buddhaïsts.”
## 20: Blavatsky (1888) 19 [0]

>This explanation is absolutely necessary at the beginning of a work like the present. The Wisdom‐Religion is the inheritance of all the nations, the world over, in spite of the statement made in Esoteric Buddhism that “two years ago (i.e., in 1883), neither I, nor any other European living, knew the alphabet of the Science, here for the first time put into a scientific shape,” etc. This error must have crept in through inadvertence. The present writer knew all that is “divulged” in Esoteric Buddhism, and much more, many years before it became her duty (in 1880) to impart a small portion of the Secret Doctrine to two European gentlemen, one of whom was the author of Esoteric Buddhism; and surely the present writer has the undoubted, though to her, rather equivocal, privilege of being a European by birth and education. Moreover, a considerable part of the philosophy expounded by Mr. Sinnett was taught in America, even before Isis Unveiled was published, to two Europeans and to my colleague, Colonel H. S. Olcott. Of the three teachers the latter gentleman has had, the first was a Hungarian Initiate, the second an Egyptian, the third a Hindû. As permitted, Colonel Olcott has given out some of this teaching in various ways; if the other two have not, it has been simply because they were not allowed, their time for public work having not yet come. But for others it has, and the appearance of Mr. Sinnett’s several interesting books is a visible proof of the fact. Moreover, it is above everything important to keep in mind that no Theosophical book acquires the least additional value from pretended authority.
# Magnetic Sleep

## 1: Denis (1838) 42 [7]

>Accordingly, I now proceed with the evidence. In 1820, numerous experiments were performed by me in Paris, at the Hotel-Dieu, and many incredulous physicians, attracted by the novelty, witnessed them, and wished to satisfy themselves that there was no deception. To this I assented, and accordingly they proceeded to prove the insensibility of the patients by a variety of tests, many of which were very cruel ; but these experiments were not performed by me ; it was a sort of sacrifice of humanity which incredulity insisted upon, and in the infancy of the science I had no alternative excepting to permit them, or allow truth itself to be compromised by the refusal. Hence the unconscious patients were subjected to the following trials : — their lips and nostrils were tickled with feathers ; their skin was pinched until ecchymoses (bruises) were produced ; smoke was introduced into the nasal passages, and the feet of one female were plunged into a strong infusion of mustard-seed at a high temperature. But not the slightest sign of pain did they evince. The expression of the countenance remained unchanged, nor was the pulse in any degree affected. On being awakened, however, out of the magnetic sleep, they all experienced the pain usually attendant on such applications, and were exceedingly angry at the treatment they had received. Many of the physicians who had witnessed this scene, and who were convinced of the reality of the magnetic influence, applied to me to teach them how to conduct the operation, and several very soon acquired the method, upon which they proceeded to convince themselves, by their own personal experiments, of the absolute extinction of sensibility in such cases. The means they adopted were on many occasions revolting, but the result removed every shade of doubt from their minds. I now, therefore, proceed to adduce their evidence. It is no longer I who attest the facts ; and praise or blame, should either be bestowed, will be alike inapplicable to me. Here, therefore, I subjoin the following proces-verbal by Dr. Kobouam, who was then attached to the Hotel-Dieu. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 6th of January, 1821, M. Recamier, on visiting the hospital, requested me to put into magnetic sleep a man named Starin, whose bed was No. 8 of the ward Sainte-Madelaine. M. Recamier first threatened him with the application of moxa,* if he allowed himself to fall asleep, and I caused the patient, much against his will, to pass into the magnetic sleep, during which M. Recamier applied the moxa on the fore-part of the right thigh, which moxa produced an eschar seventeen lines in length and eleven in breadth ; that Starin did not manifest the least sign of pain, either by crying out, gesture, or variation of the pulse ; that he did not feel the application of the moxa until I had roused him out of the magnetic sleep. Madame SainteMonique, the matron of the ward, MM. Gibert, La Peyre, Bergeret, Carquet, Truche, &c, &c, were present during this seance" Here, also, is another procesverbal by the same physician. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 8th of January, 1821, at the request of M. Recamier, I put into magnetic sleep the woman Leroy (Lise), lying in the bed No. 22 in the ward Sainte-Agnes. M. Recamier had previously threatened that he would apply a moxa to her person if she allowed herself to fall asleep. I, Robouam, then, much against her will, caused the patient to fall into magnetic sleep, during which M. Gibert burned agaric under her nostrils, and this nauseous smell produced no perceptible effect ; that afterwards M. Recamier himself applied moxa on the epigastric region (pit of the stomach), which produced an eschar of fifteen lines in length and nine in breadth ; that during the operation, the patient did not shew the least symptoms of suffering, either by cries, gestures, or variation of the pulse ; that she remained in a state of perfect insensibility, and that on awakening from the magnetic sleep, she shewed signs of suffering great pain. MM. Gibert, Crequi, &c, were present at this seance? (Signed,) Robouam, Docteur-Medecin.

>" A part only of the intellectual faculties of the somnambule remain awake ; they are all so in the magnetic somnambule with regard to those with whom he is in contact en rapport. The natural somnambule is impelled by his own imagination, and certain corporeal impressions ; the magnetic somnambule wholly depends on the will and faculties of his magnetiser. The organisation of the magnetic somnambule, that of his magnetiser, and of those persons whom the latter brings in report with him by means of a slight contact, are all, as it were, identified as one and the same being ; so that the somnambule knows inwardly what takes place in the system of another person ; feels diseases which are not his own, and has an intuitive instinct of the remedies applicable to them. This it is which, to the unspeakable scandal and indignation of classic medicine, gave birth to her rival sister, under the name of magnetic medicine. The magnetic somnambule is conscious of the state and organisation of an absent person on merely touching a vestment which has been worn, or an object which has been touched, by the same person. He can either recal or forget, at the will of his magnetiser, what he has felt during the fit of somnambulism. His sensations and perceptions may, at the will of the magnetiser, be changed ; or, in other words, he will find sweet that which is bitter, and vice versa. He may also change his predilections and habitual dispositions.

>The penetrating intensity and subtile power of the magnetic influence is best illustrated by the magnetiser performing the operation at a distance, and without the knowledge of the patient, through the intervention of such opaque bodies as a screen, folding doors, or thick walls. The possibility of the operation being conducted efficiently in this manner is established beyond a doubt ; and I proceed, therefore, to cite some few facts in proof of it, because, before entering on the explication of the phenomena of animal magnetism, it is necessary that all the facts should be distinctly detailed. On the 4th of November, 1820, the Commissioners having assembled at the Hotel Dieu, M. Husson, one of the physicians of the hospital, said to me, " You can induce sleep in a very short time ; I wish you would obtain the same result without the patient either seeing you or being aware of your presence." I replied that I was willing to try, but that did not warrant the success of the experiment, because the action at a distance depended so much on the peculiar susceptibility of the individual. We agreed, however, upon a signal which I could hear in an adjoining apartment. M. Husson was to throw a pair of scissars down upon the table, and I was then to begin the operation. Accordingly I was ushered into a closet, separated from the room by a thick partition ; and the door having a good lock and key, I felt no hesitation in locking myself in, as I wished to multiply obstacles, so that no pretext might be left for suspicion or doubt. The patient was then brought into the adjacent room, and seated at a distance of about three or four feet, with her back turned towards the closet wherein I was concealed. They then, to deceive her, began wondering why I had not yet arrived, and Ihey pretended from this delay to conjecture that I did not intend to come; at the same time, they blamed me for not keeping my appointment. In short, my alleged absence was adverted to in such a manner as to leave no doubt, on the mind of the patient, that I was really elsewhere. The signal being then given, although I knew not where nor at what distance Mile. Samson was placed, I began to magnetise in the most profound silence, carefully avoiding the least movement which might apprise her of my being present. It was then thirty-five minutes past nine. In the course of three minutes, as soon as my will began to act, she was observed to rub her eyes, exhibit the usual symptoms of approaching sleep, and at length fell into a state of somnambulism. This experiment I repeated on the 7th of November, before Professor Recamier, who took every precaution to prevent deception, and the result was precisely similar. The following are the details of this second trial : — On my entering, at a quarter past nine, the operating room, M. Husson informed me that M. Recamier wished to be present, and to see me put the patient to sleep through the partition. I readily acquiesced. M. Recamier then entered, and privately conversed with me on the subject, when we agreed upon a signal ; and I slipped into the closet, where I was again locked in. Mile. Samson was then brought in ; M. Recamier placed her with her back turned towards the closet, at a distance of more than six feet from it. He then proceeded to converse with her, and found her better ; but on being told that I was not likely to arrive, she insisted upon retiring. The moment M. Recamier asked her whether she digested meat, which was the signal agreed upon between us, I began to magnetise her at thirty-two minutes past nine. Three minutes after, M. Recamier touched her, raised her eyelids, shook her by the hands, put questions to her, pinched her, and convinced himself that she was in a state of profound magnetic sleep. But even these trials were thought insufficient to establish so extraordinary a phenomenon ; and it was resolved, therefore, to multiply them, and vary all their details. Accordingly, I went one night, accompanied by M. Husson and other physicians, to the ward in which the same patient was, and took my position from her at a distance of several beds, keeping at the same time the most profound silence, so as not to attract attention. I began magnetising her at eight minutes past seven. At twelve minutes past, we all drew near, and convinced ourselves that magnetic sleep had been induced. It is unnecessary to add, that the period fixed on for this operation had been selected, not by me, but by the principal physician of the hospital ; further, that it had been ascertained that the patient was not asleep before the experiment, and that the magnetic influence had been exerted at a distance of about twenty feet. Having witnessed these experiments, M. Bertrand, Doctor of Medicine of the University of Paris, affirmed that he did not think it extraordinary that the patient should fall asleep while the magnetiser was in the closet ; because the constant recurrence of the same attending circumstances might have, independently of my presence, produced the same results ; and that, moreover, the patient might be naturally predisposed to sleep. He therefore proposed that she should be brought into the same room, and seated on the same seat, and that a conversation should be held with her as before. This repetition of the same circumstances, he thought, would induce sleep. But he was deceived. At a quarter before ten, they began to execute the plan agreed upon ; — she was seated on the same easy chair where she usually sat, and placed in the same position. Various questions were put to her ; she was then left to her own thoughts ; the signals previously used were again repeated, — scissars were thrown upon the table ; they went, in fact, through a complete rehearsal of everything previously done, but in vain was the magnetic state expected. She complained, became restless, shifted her position, and evinced anything but a disposition to either natural or magnetic sleep. After this, on my entering the room and. commencing the operation, the magnetic sleep, accompanied by the usual state of physical insensibility was perfectly established.

>A host of additional facts of the same description are in my possession, but the evidence already brought forward will be considered conclusive to every impartial mind. Not only does the magnetic somnambulist enjoy, in this state of clairvoyance, a lucidity respecting surrounding objects and passing events, but it extends still further, inasmuch as they foresee, and distinctly foretell, the day, the hour, even the minute, when certain events will happen. This is termed the faculty of prevision, and occurs only in the very highest degree of magnetic exaltation. It may appear incredible ; but let us look to the facts. In the treatise on somnambulism by Dr. Bertrand, we find that this physician witnessed upwards of sixty convulsive fits of the most aggravated nature, which it was absolutely impossible the patient could have simulated, all of which, and their duration to a minute, had been foretold during the magnetic sleep. The same physician assures us that a somnambulist told him a fortnight previously, that she should be seized with a delirium which would last forty-three hours, which happened according to her prediction ; and he further satisfied himself that this somnambule when awake had not the slightest recollection of what she had said in her sleep. This prevision was also noticed by Drs. Rostan and Georget, one of whom observes : — " I have seen, positively seen, and repeatedly, somnambulists foretell, several hours or days — even twenty days in advance, the precise hour and minute of the accession of epileptic or hysterical fits, and describe what would be their duration and intensity, which came to pass in exact accordance with the prediction." I have myself witnessed innumerable instances of this faculty of prevision being developed during the magnetic somnambulism, but, as my authority would doubtless be impugned as ex parte evidence, I prefer again appealing to the report of the French Academicians, the validity of whose testimony cannot reasonably be challenged.

>In the " Journal de Toulouse," April 5, 1830, the following case is reported : — " We have already witnessed the curious experiments performed at Toulouse, by the Comte de Brivazac ; the document which has now reached us, gives an account of a case which occurred in the department of the Gers, at the house of the justice of peace for the canton of Condom, in the presence of several persons, among whom were some of our own acquaintance. Jean Bordere, in the before-mentioned canton, was suffering from an abscess from congestion on the fore part of the thigh. His medical attendants declared that it was necessary to lance it freely, but that the operation should be conducted with much skill and prudence, because the crural artery ran through the tumour, which was very much enlarged. The Comte de Brivazac, whose power as a magnetiser is remarkable, proposed to throw the patient into a magnetic sleep, whereby insensibility might be superinduced, in order that the pain of the operation, inevitable in a waking state, might be spared the sufferer. His proposition was accepted. At the end of two minutes the patient was thrown into the magnetic state. His lucidity was not remarkable. He answered the magnetiser that it was in vain for him to try, as he could not perceive his complaint. At that moment, Dr. Larieu began, with great dexterity, the operation. He repeatedly plunged the probe into the opening made by the bistoury, in order to let out the purulent matter, the flow of which was occasionally impeded by albuminous flakes. A dressing was immediately afterwards ; applied. During the operation, the patient remained motionless as a statue ; his magnetic sleep was in nowise disturbed, and on the proposal being mooted that he should be brought out of the magnetic "state, M. de Brivazac spontaneously awakened him. M. Roc then drawing near, asked him whether he would submit to the operation, to which he replied, " I suppose I must, since it is necessary." M. Roc then informed him that it was unnecessary to recommence, as the operation had already been performed. The astonishment of the patient was at its height, when he saw the proofs of it ; for he had seen nothing, felt nothing, and remembered nothing, excepting the act of M. de Brivazac laying the palm of his hand upon his forehead to induce sleep."

>The discovery of magnetic somnambulism, instead of advancing, rather retarded than otherwise the progress of the science, inasmuch as the facts above stated appeared so startling and incredible, that many held it superfluous even to entertain any consideration of them ; and dismissed them, at once, as idle fictions and knavish impositions. The concurrent testimony, however, of so many individuals, who had no interest whatever in the matter, and whose integrity and powers of judgment could not be impugned, induced many who were incredulous to examine the facts ; and hence observations on this phenomenon have, during the last fifty years, been accumulated in all parts of Europe, even by those very individuals who were originally the most determined and perverse sceptics. I now, therefore, proceed to describe the phenomena which magnetic somnambulists exhibit ; but it is proper to observe, that no criterion of comparison can be established between different cases, because men differ as much from one another in somnambulism as they do in their habitual waking state. The Count de Redern, a distinguished savant, who devoted much attention to animal magnetism, observes, —
## 7: Denis (1838) 118 [2]

>" It is this somnambulism, an extreme result of animal magnetism, which allows of, and promises success, through its known efficacy in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It is by means of this incomprehensible, undefinable development of the general sensibility, that magnetic somnambules acquire, without the help of the senses, not only a knowledge of the surrounding objects on which their attention is directed, either spontaneously or by the will of another, but also the faculty of distinguishing objects removed at a distance, or placed, with regard to the somnambule, beyond opaque bodies ; and, by consequence, to know the economy and functions of their own system, or the systems of the individuals presented to them. The most positive, the most authentic, and incontrovertible facts, justify, establish, and guarantee all these phenomena of magnetic somnambulism, and prove that, under certain circumstances, the lucidity of somnambules may be of great succour to determine the seat and the nature of diseases, particularly those which come under the denomination of organic diseases." He then gives the nomenclature of those affections in which it has been applied with success.

>The most extraordinary phenomenon of magnetic, as well as of natural somnambulism, is clairvoyance, or vision without the use of the eyes ; yet no fact has ever been more clearly and indisputably established. It has been already seen, nay, it is a notorious fact, that natural somnambulists enjoy this faculty. It is inexplicable in them — it is equally so in the magnetic somnambulist; but, as I have before stated, we must abide by the evidence of the fact being conclusive, and not wander Out of the path of positive observation to pursue any ignis fatuus theory which imagination may suggest to explain the mystery. It may, indeed, appear tiresome, my adducing so many authorities, and citing so many facts of the same description ; but I have no alternative ; I am anxious to show clearly that the weight of evidence in proof of their existence is irresistible ; and when I reiterate that I am myself prepared to reproduce the same phenomena, the conditions of the operation being, ceteris paribus, similar, surely the most perverse of my antagonists will allow that no fairer appeal can be made to the common sense and judgment of mankind. The cases of vision during magnetic somnambulism without the instrumentality of the eyes are very numerous, and those which I shall here adduce are selected principally on account of their being attested by living authorities — men who hold a distinguished rank in the faculty of medicine, at Paris, and in other enlightened cities.
## 9: Denis (1838) 196 [2]

>It has been said, however, that this mode of perception cannot exactly be called seeing, inasmuch as when such somnambulists are closely examined how it is that they perceive the relations of external objects, they all agree in answering that it is by a kind of inward feeling which they are unable to explain. A somnambulist of Fischer assured him that he saw his internal organs, not as with the eyes, but he could not describe the manner in which he perceived them. A patient of Hufeland's said, " I see" when she was in the highest degree of lucidity only, at other times she generally used the expression " I feel," this or that part, or this or that change, &c. A patient of Gmelin's said she did not see, but feel, and with great delicacy, both internally and externally. In the magnetic sleep, Scherb's patient also declared that her sensations were rather those of feeling than of sight, and that this peculiar feeling during that state was much more acute and delicate than when awake. A cataleptic patient of Despine's said to those who were en rapport with her, " You think that I do not know what passes around me, but you are mistaken ; I see nothing, yet I feel something which makes an impression upon me, but which I cannot explain."* These are curious facts. How far the sense of feeling may, under a peculiar state of exaltation, take cognizance of the outward forms and conditions of material objects remains yet to be determined ; certain it is, that in well-authenticated cases, both of natural and magnetic somnambulism, individuals, through some other channel than the eye itself, perceive, discriminate, and perform a variety of actions which could not be accomplished without vision being in some way or other engaged. In the animal economy it is a physiological law that one organ shall assume a preternatural activity in order to supply the function of another whose structure may be deranged ; thus it is clearly proved that the liver acts vicariously with the lungs ; the skin with the kidneys. It is the office of the lungs to throw out of the system, during expiration, carbonaceous matter ; and when, therefore, this organ is diseased, the liver assumes, in a manner, its function, and throws off the surplus carbon with the biliary secretion. Hence the frequency of diseases of the liver in those persons who have resided in tropical countries, where, owing to the climate, the lungs may have become affected. In like manner the vessels of the skin, acting vicariously with those of the kidneys, throw off the watery parts of the blood when the secretion of this organ has, from any cause, been obstructed. Here there is an unquestionable transference of function between the grosser organs of organic life — and why should not the higher organs of sense, under certain abnormal conditions, act on a similar principle, vicariously with each other ? It is well known that persons who unhappily are blind and deaf acquire a preternaturally acute sense of touch, so that they are able to discriminate by feeling, properties of bodies which could not be so appreciated by other persons. This, however, is only a very subordinate physical manifestation of that law of derivation to which I here allude ; it may, nevertheless, be the initiatory condition of that transference of the senses which is in the magnetic state much more perfected.

>In the usual magnetic sleep, there sometimes occurs a peculiar state, seldom observed, and much dreaded by magnetisers, because very few among them possess the means of bringing it to a favourable issue. I will endeavour to describe it. A person plunged in the magnetic sleep (and it generally occurs in those individuals whose sleep is most profound) collapses into an extraordinary state, of which the following are the chief symptoms : — The somnambulist who heard his magnetiser perfectly, is suddenly seized with a fit of deafness ; he neither hears nor feels him any longer ; and the magnetiser discovers that he has entirely lost all control over him ; he no longer obeys his injunctions ; he is as dumb to him as to every body else ; his jaws are firmly fixed together, and it would be easier to break than sunder them ; he is motionless, yields to the laws of gravitation, and his body appears powerfully attracted to the ground. The pulse at the wrist diminishes its beats in number and intensity ; the temperature of the body perceptibly lowers, and inevitable death appears to be impending. If the magnetiser be familiar with this phenomenon, and do not abandon the patient, he will gradually recover from this state of concentration ; the pulse will resume its usual cadence, and, returning into the ordinary state of somnambulism, he will, on being questioned, state that he has had certain visions during his lethargic state ; but, by a strange anomaly, although still in the somnambulic state, he can hardly recal them, or even describe the sensations he experienced.
## 11: Denis (1838) 323 [2]

>How, excepting on magnetic principles, can we interpret the following anecdote of Alexander the Great ? It is related by Cicero that Ptolemy having been wounded by a poisoned arrow, was in great pain, and likely to die, when Alexander, sitting at the edge of the bed in a profound sleep, the dragon, nourished by his mother Olympia, appeared to him with a certain root in his mouth, and told him where it was to be found, which was not far from that place, and that it possessed such virtues that it would soon cure Ptolemy. On awakening, Alexander narrated his dream to his friend ; — they then sought the root, which was found, and not only was Ptolemy cured, but many other soldiers who had been wounded by the same arrows.* We have already seen that magnetic somnambulists prescribe, and that successfully, for the complaints of others, and here we have precisely the same fact. A cavern is also mentioned by Strabo, to which the sick resorted for the purpose of consulting sleeping priests. We learn, too, from Cicero, that when the Lacedemonian magistrates were embarrassed in their administration, they went to sleep in the temple of Pasiphae, so called from Past Phainein, te communicative to all." To the clairvoyance and lucidity which often occur during somnambulism may be referred many of the visions and predictions which are recorded in ancient history. The mystery of Oracles, the prophetic raving of the Sybils, the predictions of many of the ancient philosophers, are all explicable on the same principle. That the Sybils uttered their ratiocinations in a state of magnetic crisis or extase is clear, from the account given by St. Justin, who remarks that they did not themselves understand what they said, and that as soon as the instinct which animated them was extinguished, they lost all recollection of what they had predicted.* The Sybils and Bacchides, says Aristotle, who fall into a state of enthusiasm called sacred, do so, not from disease, but only from their natural temperament.-)- Avicenna also repudiates the idea of their being possessed, and, fantastically enough, ascribes their power of divination to the black bile4 Louis Buccaferrei, of Bologna, one of the commentators on Aristotle, insists that the gift of prophecy depends entirely on the temperament, and the melancholic is the one to which he assigns the development of this faculty .§ Gaspard Pencer wrote a treatise professedly on divination, in which he adopts partially the theory of Buccaferrei, but insists that in many cases it is a faculty peculiar to certain individuals.* The Jews, more than any other nation of antiquity, appear to have cultivated this somnambulic power : Josephus himself was constantly in what we now term a state of crisis, that is, in the highest degree of somnambulism, in which prevision is developed. On the authorities of Suetonius, Dio, and all Roman historians, he foretold the succession of Vespasian and Titus to the Roman empire, and this he did in the days of Nero, before Galba, Otho, or Vitellius, were thought of to succeed him. His faith in the lucidity of such visions was manifested on the occasion of his being in imminent danger after the fall of Jotapata. When the city had been taken, he sought refuge from the enemy in a deep pit, adjoining a large cavern, which could not be seen above ground. Here he met with forty persons of eminence, who had also, in a similar manner, concealed themselves; but on the third day he was betrayed by a woman, upon which Vespasian sent two tribunes to him, and ordered them to give Josephus their right hands as a security for his life, and to exhort him to come up. He was, however, afraid to comply with the request, lest he should be punished ; and Vespasian then sent Nicanor, a personal acquaintance of Josephus, to persuade him that no such perfidy would be committed. Thereupon the enraged soldiery threatened to set fire to the cavern, which the tribune would not permit, being desirous that Josephus should be taken alive. " And now," I quote the history itself, "as Nicanor lay hard at Josephus to comply, and he understood how the multitude of enemies threatened him, he called to mind the dreams which he had dreamed in the nighttime, whereby God had signified to him beforehand both the future calamities of the Jews, and the events which concerned the Roman emperors. Now Josephus was well able to give shrewd interpretations of such dreams as have been ambiguously delivered by God. Moreover he was not unacquainted with the prophecies contained in the sacred books, as being a priest himself and of the posterity of priests. And just then was he in an ecstacy ; and, setting before him the tremendous images of the dreams he had lately had, he put up a secret prayer to God, and said, * Since it pleaseth thee, who hast created the Jewish nation, to depress the same ; and since all their good fortune is gone over to the Romans ; and since thou hast made choice of this soul of mine to foretel what is to come to pass hereafter, I willingly give them my hands, and am content to live ; and I protest openly, that I do not go over to the Romans as a deserter from the Jews, but as a minister from thee.' When he had said this, he complied with Nicanor's invitation."* From what follows, it appears that Vespasian himself at last gave credit to his predictions. Nay, when Josephus was led by Nicanor before Vespasian, we almost recognise a direct magnetical action on those by whom he was immediately surrounded : they who were remote from him, cried out that he should be put to death ; but they who were near his person, relented, and were subdued.

Theology, metaphysics, psychology, she answers all in a sense tinctured with neither pride nor error. Should the materialist not obtain from her the proofs he desires, he can not accuse her of entangling the question, or of bad faith. For several years past, in her magnetic sleep, she lives with the beings of the other world ; give her but the Christian and surname of the deceased persons, no matter at what period we desire her to perceive or consult, and she sees and converses with them at will. Hitherto, she has never failed in one experiment, and we shall be astonished at her clairvoyance, and the exact details she gives of persons who have departed this life.

>We generally believe that all created things existed from all eternity, and we ought not to confound, as I have said in the foregoing article, the enjoyment of the sight of the world of causes with the creation of the causes themselves. God can indeed, in a far superior manner to man, enjoy the harmony of his thoughts, which, with him, form but a perfect unity, and which with man form two, because man proceeds from the Divine thought, and is not God; he enjoys Hke God, when he is spiritualized, the view of the thoughts under their typical forms, but he does not create these thoughts; thus it remains proved to us, that the thoughts of the Eternal Being from all eternity, since they are of him, can not be annihilated without parcelling out the Divine Person ; man, who is one of these innumerable thoughts, exists like them from all eternity, he changes his condition like them all when they become materialized, and this gives rise to the belief in a spontaneous birth, because we take the effect for the cause, come to a stop at appearances, and not at the reality. Thus the soul having existed before dwelling in our body, has existed somewhere, in some form or other, and lived a life of activity, for there is no possible repose in nature ; all conduces to movement, without the latter it is nothingness, it is the parcelling out of the Great Being ; as I have said it is impossible. It must, therefore, be admitted that if the soul has existed from all time, it may have lived under the form of a germ ; and again, this form of a germ might be man himself, for every germ has its form within it and all its attributes, so then a form and all its attributes, without movement, without vibration, can not exist. Even though we should assimilate the germ man to the germ flower, it would not the less be proved that these two germs contain within them all that they must one day develop without them, are not the less as complicated as full of life, bound up in their envelope as in their bloom ; then we are constrained to admit a prior existence to the material one, and are equally constrained to place ourselves somewhere. This somewhere for us should be a place ; this place should be appropriated to our mode of being. Thus, we must have lived in this place, and in order to live it is necessary to act, we have acted ; in order to live it is necessary to feel, we have felt, but imperfectly, as has been just proved to us. We stood in need of a new position, in order to render an account to ourselves of the first one ; all beings are conscious of this pre-existence, and I can not do better than quote on this head what I am at this very moment reading (six months after the revelation was made to me), in a work of M. Loisson de Guinaumont, entitled *' Somnologie Magnetique,''^ P^ge '''4. Never was description more explicit and of better effect, especially from the affinity it has with this article.

>88. Emile Rey, ten years of age, of a waggish and very curious disposition, was a little neighbor of mine, and frequently came to spend an evening at my house, when I used to make him recite a few pieces in verse. When I had made the magic glass I have already spoken of, the composition of which was given me by M. Swedenborg, I had a mind to try the first experiment on Emile, though I did not think his turbulent nature well adapted to these kinds of visions, for which a little submission is required. He perceived nothing in it, but, as I have just said, he was very inattentive. One of his little comrades of a more quiet disposition, perceived in it different things which he desired to see, and this gave me the assurance that my mirror was a good one. I had a mind to try again on Emile, by the experiment of the water-bottle, which Cagliostro often employed to convince his auditors of his magic power : he beheld very distinctly divers remote places ; perceiving, from this, that he had propensities for the magnetic sleep, I magnetized him, and in a few minutes he slept; his curious disposition led him to travelling ; he acquired, in a very short time, this speciality, and left me no doubt as to the worth of his clairvoyance. It was this child of whom I spoke farther back, whose sleep was called in question by M. Demarest, because, in a distant view at that gentleman's house, he took a surtout for a paletot, and, in a closed box, a small twosous piece for a liard. I tried to put this child in communication with spirits disengaged from matter ; I told him to ask to see his an^el. " Here he is." — " How is he dressed ?" " He is quite naked." — I repeated a prayer for the dismissal of this spirit if he were not sent by God ; Emile said, " I no longer see anything, he is gone." I summon the good one. " Here he is ; 'tis no longer the same." — "Why so?" '* This one is dressed ; he has a blue robe, a pink girdle, beautiful white wings, fine flaxen hair ; he is much handsomer than the other!" I desire the latter to be gone, as the former ; he remains, and tells Emile that he is sent by God. " By what sign may you be recognised, in case the evil one should think proper to take your place V He points out to Emile a small white spot on his forehead. "Have you lived on earth 1" "Yes." — "When did you die?" "I don't knovi^." — "What do you do in heaven V " I play there ; we have plenty of amusement." — "With whom do you play f "With children of my own age ; I ride on horseback." — I ask Emile how old this angel appears to be. He replies : " About my age." — " Are you fond, too, of riding V " Very ; my angel is on a fine dapple-gray horse." — "What! at this moment?" "Yes." — " What is there in heaven V* " A fine garden, fine fruits, fine flowers." — " Can we eat these fruits and pluck these flowers?" — " No, God forbiJs it." " Does your angel see the earth ?" " No, he can see only heaven." — " Does he see the men of the earth 1" " No, he can see but me." — " Can he see me also 1" " He could do so, since you are en rapport with me." — "Would your angel be so good as to show himself to you when you have been waked up?" "Yes." — I terminate this sitting. Emile, on awaking, perceives his angel when I lay my hand on his heart, as he had recommended me to do ; he gives me the same details as to his dress as when sleeping.

>To initiate your clairvoyante in this kind of apparition, first look out for a subject as independent as possible of your will ; make no physical experiment wherein the communication of thoughts is often necessary. Seek for a natural, voluntary clairvoyante, and not a sickly one, if possible. Conduct his speciality toward these communications, without ever demanding of him any but those appertaining to maladies. Begin by interesting him in an apparition, asking him if he would not be glad to see some departed friend who had been dear to him ; he will be curious, his desire will be strong, and the person mentally demanded by you and by him will shortly present himself. Continue this kind of experiment, changing the personage as often as you can. As soon as you perceive that the view of a deceased being greatly affects your clairvoyante, that he appears delighted at seeing him again, tell him to ask this spirit to have the goodness to conduct him into the places he inhabits ; he will readily do so, on one condition, which is that the clairvoyante shall descend again to earth, after a short interval of time, not exceeding ten minutes, according to the susceptible nature of the subject. To aid him in his departure, place him under the care of God and his guide ; place your hand at some distance from the crown of his head, your fingers downward and brought together to a point, desire them to attract and open the fictitious space necessary to the passage of the soul. When you see him leaning back, his arms languidly dropping down, his face flushed and assuming an expression of beatitude, leave him for the time agreed upon in this ecstatic contemplation. For prudence sake, ever keep your eyes fixed on the plexus, principally the solar or pit of the stomach, retaining by your will sufficient life in the body to prevent all risk. If your clairvoyant should not return at the appointed time, and you perceive that his countenance is getting discolored, assuming a dark sallow hue, proceed no further, death is at hand. Close the door upon him, making with a determined force of will, a few transversal passes over his head and before his face ; if it be long before he answers you, do n't be disturbed, do as if you were pulling him from on high with a cord, blow warmly on his heart, and you will see him pass again into the ordinary state of magnetic sleep. Ask him what he has seen, do not laugh, or you will learn nothinor. Be of sfood faith, see in his revelations an act of madness or truth without telling him of it, and think what you please. All the counsels I have just given are dictated only by a wise prudence ; there are many ecstatics of different shades, with whom we have no need of this prudence ; but there are some with whom we can not be too circumspect, as I well know by experience. We ought to consider ourselves as warned on this head ; death or insanity might be the consequence of such attempts. The ecstasy by which we communicate with spirits on earth presents no danger ; it is one of the tasks which somnambulists perform with the greatest facility. I also recommend that if the clairvoyante, in speaking with spirits, should solicit from you certain marks of respect or assent to certain gestures, still preserving your dignity as a man, who ought to bend the knee to his Creator only, refuse not doing what could not in the least affect you. Be covfiding, reserved, voluntary , reasonable, devoid of passion, and you will be indemnified for your pains, rendering yourself more happy than you ever were before ; you will be less inclined to curse the earth and its sorrows, inasmuch as you will perceive that those sorrows are beneficial ; you will no longer, in your sufferings, accuse God, because you will know that he is infinitely good ; you will no longer be puffed up with your knowledge, because the further you go, the more you will perceive that you know nothing ; you will patient admire this terrestrial mechanism, so beautiful, so grand, in one point of view, so insignificant in another ; you will be in haste to again inhabit your former dwelling and be less attached to your material baubles. You will no longer tremble before your coffin, which is the gate to the temple of happiness wherein you are to live for ever ! !

>On earth is there aught that we can hide from the perception of a clairvoyante ? It is not, therefore, ridiculous to admit that in the world of spirits none is any longer able to conceal aught ; it is the book of life which will be open to all. The masks of calm concealing rage, smiles concealing bitterness, virtue concealing vice, will be left on earth. We can not deny these truths after having studied magnetic somnambulism. Need we invite our readers to a perusal of the works of the learned Swede 1 No, these few passages, we are certain of it, will be a better invitation than any we could give. We abstain, therefore, from all insinuation in this respect.

>In this state there is a strong sympathy existing between the operator and his subject. The chain of sympathy which connects the mind of the operator with that of his subject, is animal electricity, — the same fluid which is the agent of all muscular motion. It is through the agency of this fluid that magnetic sleep is induced. The operator sits down with the determination to put his subject to sleep: all the powers of his mind are concentrated on this object. His will being exercised to this point, the electric fluid passes from his own brain and nerves, to the brain and system of his patient, and forms between the two, a chain of sympathy. The one, then, is completely subject to the control of the other; and in this manner you may easily account for all the phenomena witnessed in the sympathetic somnambulist.

>In Prussia, Austria, Bavaria, Russia, laws were passed by the respective governments, prohibiting its practice by all persons, excepting by physicians regularly educated. In France, the discovery by the Marquis de Puysegur of magnetic somnambulism had already thrown an additional charm over its study, and enriched physiology and psychology with a newly-developed class of facts in the highest degree curious and interesting. Next to Puysegur appeared the Abbe Faria, who opened in Paris an institution for magnetism which attracted the attention of many scientific men. He was himself endued with the magnetic power to a degree which would have appeared incredible, were it not a notorious fact that its intensity augments with exercise. The daily increasing converts to magnetism attached themselves to this man of wonders ; they listened with interest to his lectures, and learned by his instructions how themselves to conduct the operation. It is impossible to conceive a more direct and conclusive experimentum cruris than this. The magnetiser assumed not to himself any exclusive privilege, nor did he pretend to be initiated in any mysterious or incommunicable cabalistic art ; on the contrary, he assured his auditors that they had only to investigate the phenomena to be convinced of their reality, and invited them in their turn to try the operation themselves, assuring them that they would be as successful as himself, if they only complied with the elementary principles of the science, which are in themselves simple and explicit, and equally intelligible to all. The instructions of the Abbe Faria were by many followed, — his predictions verified : and who that has thus practically studied animal magnetism has ever turned away sceptical from it ?

>It has been already stated that the magnetic operation induces sleep ; it is a state of sleep, however, very different from natural sleep ; its phenomena were first described by the Marquis de Puyscgur, but, in conformity with the plan already laid down, I shall detail its physical conditions before proceeding to those phenomena, which are of a purely psychical nature, and in the highest degree interesting, inasmuch as they reveal to us the manifestations of a spiritual existence, independent of the ordinary instruments of corporeal organisation. In contradistinction to the natural, this has been termed the magnetic sleep, or somnambulism, which may be more or less complete, — that is to say, its phenomema may be more or less perfectly developed. In this peculiar state of sleep, the surface of the body is sometimes acutely sensible, — but more frequently the sense of feeling is absolutely annihilated. The jaws are firmly locked, and resist every effort to wrench them open ; the joints are often rigid, and the limbs inflexible ; and not only is the sense of feeling, but the senses of smell, hearing, and sight, also, are so deadened to all external impressions, that no pungent odour, loud report, or glare of light, can excite them in the slightest degree. The body may be pricked, pinched, lacerated, or burnt; fumes of concentrated liquid ammonia may be passed up the nostrils ; the loudest reports suddenly made close upon the ear ; dazzling and intense light may be thrown upon the pupil of the eye ; yet so profound is the physical state of lethargy, that the sleeper will remain undisturbed, and insensible to tortures, which, in the waking state, would be intolerable. These may appear startling assertions, and it should be conceded, that in proportion as any alleged facts may appear extraordinary, do they demand additional weight of evidence to establish them. This state of insensibility, now described, therefore requires to be proved by the most direct positive evidence; it must be evidence, at once clear, unequivocal, and above all suspicion ; it must be evidence, too, that is tangible to those who will entertain the investigation, and this I am prepared to adduce. Can more in reason be desired ? I cite authorities, I refer to scenes which occurred in public hospitals, in the presence of living witnesses, conscientious and competent observers, only because I cannot bring the experiments under the eye of the reader while perusing this page ; but if he choose to visit any of my public seances, he may convince himself, by personal observation, of the truth of the facts which are here stated ; and I make this appeal, fully sensible how difficult it is to disturb that apathy which scepticism usually engenders, or to excite even the desire of inquiry in minds which have already come prematurely to a conclusion.
## 20: Denis (1838) 48 [1]

>To this testimony of M. Bouillet, may be added that of M. Husson, President of the Academy of Medicine, who, in his address to that learned Society, observes, — " The operator has succeeded, during this singular state (somnambulism), in producing paralysis, or so entirely closing the senses against all external impressions, that a bottle containing several ounces of concentrated ammonia was held immediately under the nostrils, for five, ten, fifteen minutes, or more, without producing the slightest effect; without impeding respiration, or provoking sternutation. The skin was perfectly insensible, even when pinched so as to leave black marks ; nay, it was absolutely insensible to the burning of moxa, and to the acute irritation of hot water strongly impregnated with mustard, although when the skin recovered its normal state, the pain thereby caused was intensely felt." The authority of Dr. Bertrand may be cited to the same effect. " I saw," he observes, " insensibility so decidedly manifested in certain magnetic somnambules, that it could be proved by the most conclusive tests. I saw a magnetiser who used to put his somnambules to sleep before a numerous assembly, and entreat every person present to provide himself with a pin, and thrust them all unexpectedly, at the same moment, into different parts of the body. Accordingly, while the somnambulist was on one occasion singing, forty or fifty pins were thus thrust simultaneously into his flesh without causing the least appreciable alteration in his voice."

>99. M. Lucas, the person interested at the foregoing sitting, returned a few days after to ask me if I had heard anything new respecting his brother-in-law. I had not paid any attention to the matter. The mother of the lost man accompanied M. Lucas, and asked me if I could give her a sitting. I made a slight objeclion, because I was hoMing a conference with several persons ; but, on the observation of M. Lucas, who told me that this lady had come several leagues expressly to obtain fresh information, and that the coach was waiting for her, I begged the persons present to excuse me, and judge of the experiment about to take place. Adele, once asleep, said, " I see him." — " Where do you see him ?" " Here, present." — *' Give us once more a description of him, as also of the place where he is." " He is a fair man, browned by the heat of the sun ; very corpulent, features pretty regular, hazel eyes, mouth large, air sombre and meditative. He is in the garb of a working man — a sort of small blouse ; as at the last time, he is at work, gathering seeds like enough to peppercorns, but I don't think they are, as they seem bigger. This seed is found in small shrubs ab jut three feet hicrh. I see a nesrro near, who is doing the same thing." — " Try and obtain an answer to-day ; let him tell you the name of the country where you see him." "He won't answer me." — " Tell him that it is his good mother whom he was so fond of, who is with you, and bids you inquire after him." " Oh ! at the name of his mother he turned round and said to me, ' My mother ! I shall not die before seeing her again; comfort her, and tell her that I am always thinking of her; I a.m not dead!'" — "Why does he not write to herl" *' He has written to her, but no doubt the vessel was wrecked ; at least he presumes so, as he received no answer. He tells me that he is at Mexico : he followed the emperor, Don Pedro ; was five years a prisoner, sufiered much, and will make every effort to return to Fiance ; they will see him again." — " Can he name the place he lives in ?" " No, it is far up in the country ; such places have no names." — " Is he with a European ?'* " No, with a man of color." — " Why does he not write to his mother 1" *' Because where he is no vessels come; he knows not to whom to apply ; then, again, he scarcely ever knew how to write, and now less than ever ; no one near him can render him this service, no one speaks his language ; he has much pains in making himself understood ; withal, he never was of an open or communicative disposition ; he has a somewhat unsociable look. It is a hard malter to get a word out of him; one would thirdc he was dumb." — " In short, how manage to write to him or hear from him ?" " He can't tell ; all he can say is, ' I am in Mexico, I am not dead, they'll see me again.' " — " Why did he thus forsake his parents without saying a word to them, since he was happy with them 1" " This man was far from being communicative ; he scarcely ever spoke, was very fond of his mother, but had not the same affection for his father, who was a stern, sour kind of man, and often used him roughly. The cup had long been filled up to the brim ; it was not the slight altercation he had with his father, the night before his departure, that induced him to leave : it was a plan decided on long before; he communicated it to no one, and started off stealthily. Having embraced them all over night, he sneaked off the next morning, without saying a word. Make yourself easy, madam, you will see him again." The good woman melted into tears as she recognised the truthfulness of each detail given her by Adele ; she had not a word to retrench from this description ; the character, the instruction, and the departure of her son, were precisely such as Adele described ; but what gives an air of greater probability to the clairvoyante's recital as to the country he lives in, is, that some of his relatives entertained the idea that he had enlisted into Don Pedro's army, and took steps at that time to acquire a certainty of it. M. Lucas furnished me with this particular some time after wlien on a visit to Paris : no information, however, could be obtained in this respect. What no less contributed to astonish this good woman, as well as M. Lucas and the person present at this curious sitting, was to see Adele, who, to screen herself from the burning rays of the sun of these countries, put her hand up to the left side of her face as if suffocating with heat ; but the most marvellous part of the scene was that she received a violent coup-de-soleil, that rendered all this side of her face, from the forehead to the shoulder, of a reddish blue, while the other side remained perfectly white ; and full twentyfour hours elapsed before this deep color commenced disappearing. The heat was so violent there for a moment, that it was impossible to keep one's hand on it. Present at this sitting was M. Haranger Pirlot, formerly a magnetizer, and honorably known for more than thirty years in the magnetic world. He told me that he never saw the like of this. The good woman took her leave quite consoled, unable to account to herself how that her son, who was in Mexico, could be between her and Adele, and how the latter could have received a coup-de-soleil when nobody felt the heat, the weather that day being very gloomy. I am not more advanced than she, and believe that many others in our place will be like us. We submit this question to the learned ; awaiting their answer, let us pass on to another sitting.
## 2: Cahagnet (1855) 352 [4]

>137. Madame Vedeaux, for fifteen years a student of magnetism, finding herself momentarily at Paris, desires to avail herself of this opportunity of paying a visit to several clairvoyant subjects. She took a sitting at a young person's, whose clairvoyance she had been previously enabled to judge of. To a question put by this lady, the clairvoyante replied : *' I know but one somnambulist in Paris who can give you a solution to the question you ask : go to No. 17 Rue Tiquetonne ; you will find there a subject surrounded by angels and departed spirits that direct her, so that she is much more elevated than I am." Acting upon this advice, the lady came and asked me for a distant-view sitting. I did not promise her a clairvoyance of the first order, such views not being Adele's speciality, and not having for the moment any subject at my disposition. Agreeably to the wishes of my fair visiter, I begged Adele to look over this lady's property, and tell us whether there was any hidden treasure there. She replied thus : *' I see some water, apparently, to me, in a cistern ; it is dark ; then a turret, not unlike a dove-cot. It is contiguous to a house that stands by itself, and surrounded with fields. There is a room on the ground-floor with two windows ; on the first floor there is a room which also has two windows. This house is three stories high ; the main building has two wings, with which there is a communication by the staircases and corridors where the turret stands; it is quite a small room, in which I see a spirit wandering : it is a person who was murdered there a verylong time ago." Adele shrinks back in affright : I quiet her and she says that she is dragged toward a small store-room on the ground-floor, in which she can scarcely stand upright ; she sees there some wine, and declares that under this spot has been hidden a treasure contained in a small strong box, in which she perceives jewels, silver, and plate. She goes on giving descriptions, superfluous for the reader to know, but very agreeable for this lady to hear. The day after this sitting, the lady returned to acquaint me that she had. been again to see her somnambulist, who held with her, as near as may be, this discourse : " You ought to be satisfied with the clairvoyante I made you acquainted with. 1 fear but one thing, which is, that her lucidity should deprive me of your kind visits, for I am very much attached to you ; it was to give you a proof of this that I feared not making you acquainted with another clairvoyante more powerful than myself. I perceive that she spoke to you of a spirit that wandered. about the property she visited, the result of a murder : that is very true ; I see it also. It is a pity that this clairvoyante should be too reserved and too much afraid of telling us all she sees ; there would be moments wherein she would confound the most incredulous. She is too fearful of committing mistakes ; her magnetizer ought to know that." I replied to this lady, that it was true that if Adele was a little less afraid of committing mistakes, she would be capable of greater things. It is her reserve that proves her lucidity ; she is aware how pictures which present themselves to the eye may lead to error, seeing that they represent the past, present, and future, as present, although in the world of causes, wherein are perceived the various states of their manifestation, there can be no errors: however, they are possible in their material efl*ects, which are or are not manifested. If man studied with great attention this somnambulic or spiritual state, which he yet knows but imperfectly, he would not be so ready to inveigli against errors, especially if unable to verify the revelations of the clairvoyantes. I have spoken of this curious sitting merely to have an opportunity of repeating what I have already said in the first volume, that it was not necessary to guide clairvoyantes, step by step, toward the object we desire to have visited by them ; for Adele, at this sitting, formed no communication with the lady : she asked for the chateau, and it forthwith appeared. What has made me thus act, is, that knowino- a clairvoyante able to find out the traces of an object stolen or lost, of a person missing, &c., in these researches, he can be guided by no human thought ; the desired object, therefore, must present itself at the call of the clairvoyante, or the latter must proceed toward it without any itinerary. It may then, I say to myself, be the sam.e with all views at a distance ; of this I have obtained proof a hundred times. Even yesterday, a doctor of high repute, who believes in magnetism because he is so under my influence that I force him to confess it (whenever he seems disposed to deviate from the truth) that he can offer no opposition to my closing his eyes, for instance, if I will it, until he begs of me to open them for him (and he does not sleep) — he was in the same disposition of mind with regard to somnambulism and views at a distance, when yesterday, as I was saying, I somnambulized my little Emile, and intrusted him to the doctor to question him at his ease. Out of more than forty answers, he raised doubts only on two or three made by a spirit whom he caused to be questioned at a distance. His surprise was not less great when I assured him that the really living person whose spirit responded to that of my little clairvoyante, of twelve years of age, knew nothing of this little secret intriguing and those confidences, in which, however, he would have taken good care not to compromise himself by answers injurious to him. The doctor, before taking the hand of the clairvoyante, had already a description of the house into which he had sent him. On this simple invitation from me to the child : " The doctor desires that you should see a house into which he wishes you to enter." " I see it," forthwith said the child, " it is a new house," &c. This method of proceeding would not bo admissible unless it succeeded as well as the other; but is it not demonstrated by the aforementioned experiment for researches, thefts, &c., so common in our days 1 What makes me more attached to these experiments is, that I wish to prove, that if an object unknown to the clairvoyante presents itself to his view, agreeably to his wishes — if actions passed like those attending all the circumstances of a theft, or the journey of a person whose trace has been lost, present themselves to him — I say, the person who has done or produced these actions, must exist equally as well as those actions which appear to our material eyes completely dead ; and the soul which has produced such thinffs can no more refuse to come, at the call of the clairvoyante, than these scenes refuse appearing. I wish also to observe, that the clairvoyante who addressed Madame Devaux has not the least knowledge of Adele in her watchful state, and the same may be said of Adele with regard to her. I will say, moreover, that in the view at distance Adele took, it must be observed that she declares it impossible for her to stand upright in the store-room, which really is, as this lady has said, too small to admit of her doing so materially. It is, therefore, not the view alone that goes toward that spot — it is the whole spiritual individual, as I have already remarked at the commencement of this volume, in my answer to magnetizers who believe that apparitions are a transmission of thoughts, and as I have proved in the view Adele took of Mexico, in which she received a coup-de-soleil (though it was rainy weather). It can not be for a moment doubted but that the clairvoyante is wholly in the places he visits at a distance, although answering our questions by the organs of his material body, as if still within it. If, perchance, it should be arg-ued that he sees these thing-s in the thought of the questioner, although the contrary is mathematically proved by the details present, which he gives you of places you have not seen for many years, and the changes that have taken place since your departure ; these details can not be in your thoughts, since you are not acquainted with them, and ulterior information only proves to you their reality. This is a logical proof, admitting of no reply ; but, as there are persons who have a reply for all, and who, prejudiced in their belief of the transmission of thoughts, see but it, I beg them to tell me how a clairvoyante can walk about in the least of their thoucrhts, which represents a place capable of containing thousands of spirits similar to the one visiting them. If I ask a solution of this from these savans, it is less to combat the truth of it than to fix for an instant their vast conception on this explanation, by which they believe they have nothing more to reply. I will tell them that it deserves a little more attention, and can not, though really existing, answer the question I address to them. Does the clairvoyante see only what you have seen or thought? Certainly not ; since every day you obtain proofs of the contrary. In that case, then, where does he see these things 1 Where they are, no doubt. And they are, where we suppose them materially to be, far from us. If they are far from us, and the spirit goes to visit them, in body and not in sight — as it is easy for you to make sure of— who can convey it to these places, the doors being shut, and the walls well cemented ? Answer, I say to you. Is it the places that come to your clairvoyante 1 Who brings these places into your room ? I puzzle you a little more than I shall be puzzled, in answering you that the soul, disengaged from matter, has no more difficulties to encounter in coming at your request than the clairvoyante experiences in going unseen by your material eyes to those remote places, or than those places have in coming to you.

>" Having thus conferred together, and resolved upon treating the subject seriously, remove from the patient all such persons as might annoy you, and keep none but the necessary witnesses (one only, if possible,) in the room. Then prepare yourself so as to be neither too warm nor too cold, and to enjoy perfect freedom in your gestures ; you should also take your precautions not to be interrupted during the sitting. These preliminaries arranged, seat your patient as conveniently as possible, and place yourself opposite to him, on a seat rather more elevated than his, so as to hold his knees between yours, and to touch your feet with his own. Request him to give himself up, to think of nothing, and not to distract his attention by examining the effects he may experience ; to be full of hope, and not to be uneasy or alarmed, should the magnetic influence produce in him momentary pains. After having composed yourself, hold his thumbs between your fingers, so that the inside of your thumbs may touch the inside of his, and fix your eyes upon him. You may remain from two to five minutes in this position, or until you feel that your thumbs and his are at the same temperature. This being done, you must withdraw your hands, by moving them outwardly right and left, so that the inward surface be turned outwards, and raise them as high as the head ; you must then lay them on both shoulders, and leave them there for about one minute ; then bring them down along the arms to the extremity of the fingers, touching slightly all the way. You will repeat this manipulation five or six times, keeping your hands off the body when you raise them. You will then hold your hands above the head for a moment, and draw them down before the face, at a distance of about two inches, as low as the pit of the stomach. Here you will stop again for about two minutes, laying your thumbs on the pit of the stomach, and your fingers under the ribs. You will then slowly come down the body as low as the knees. These manipulations should be repeated during the greater part of the sitting. You will also occasionally come nearer to the patient, so as to lay your hands behind his shoulders, and bring them slowly down the spine, and thence over the hips and along the thighs, down to the knees or to the feet. When you wish to bring the sitting to a close, you must take care to draw the magnetic fluid to the extremities of the hands and feet, by lengthening your line of motion beyond these extremities, each time shaking your fingers. Lastly, you will make before the face, and even before the breast, a few transverse manipulations, at a distance of three or four inches. It is essential to magnetise invariably downward from the head toward the extremities, and never upwards from the extremities towards the head. The downward manipulations are magnetic, — that is, they are accompanied with the intention of magnetising. The movements made upwards are not so. When the magnetiser operates upon the magnetisee, they are said to be en rapport — which means a peculiar and acquired disposition, by virtue of which the magnetiser exerts an influence upon the magnetisee ; in other words, a communication of vital principle is^established between them ; and when this has once taken place, the magnetic action is renewed at every subsequent sitting, the instant the operation begins."

>6. On a mentor, who superintends their education; Ai's had told me in a former sitting, that a saint instructed them. This child is so lively that he scarcely awaits the answers made him ; to this may bo attributed the mistake he made as to the decease of the father of Ais. We see by M. Swedenborg, as by M. Mallet, that a number consists of 20. 7. There is also accord as to the coronation. 8. As to the festivals. 9. As to the possible union and caresses of two children. 10. As to their belief, in communicating with each other, through speech ; this, also, Emile had told me, when, on the contrary, it is through thought, through sensation. Here, then, are ten secrets in which they perfectly agree. It is necessary to observe that I did not magnetize this child once in two months, his mother having an objection to it. We may judge what facility is prepared for somnambulists in communicating with the deceased, especially when rightly brought up for this purpose, and prU' dently guided in this speciality. I return to an observation to which I did not give sufficient importance : that is, to prepare the questions we desire to address, not to suffer ourselves to be led away by those raised by the answers we obtain; keep them for the next sitting, you will have had time to reflect on them, and prepare them better. They may, sometimes, accord with others that have preceded them, which would be a needless repetition, for we have been enabled to appreciate that an answer very often contains several solutions ; hence it is, that at the first sitting, Binet used to say to me : " You have already been answered that question." — I did not believe it; I had not comprehended him, and I found at a later period that he was right. Such conversations, likewise, present in the reading a void which is, at times, painful. It will be understood that this is not a history whose every detail should be consigned with harmony and a certain elegance of style, in order to arailse. Here we instruct ourselves, pick up information in the road of the infinite, the unknown, to construct the universal history of creation and the human destination. We are but a very poor workman for a monument so colossal. A skilful architect will one day come to unite these materials, and adorn with them the edifice at which we have been courageously working for so many years. Many questions, also, are found unanswered ; the spirit, no doubt, perceiving that our intelligence is not open to such revelations. It is silent — and we insist not. "We ask for the spiritual obole with humility, and stop in time when we find that we are importunate.

>Many magnetizers are easily enough disgusted with somnambulism ; good somnambulists are always useful to consult; it is very frequently the magnetizers who disorganize them by the strangeness of their questions. We should be convinced, once for all, that it is necessary to train every somnambulist to one speciality, suited to his tastes and the kind of instruction we desire. How conceive that a somnambulist should answer at the same sitting questions hurried, and so little in accord as these : " Can you tell me what I have in my pocket V* ** Can you read this letter?" " Can you see where I suffer?" " Can you tell me what my brother is doing in Africa V* " Can you see whether I shall gain such a law-suit V " Can you tell what such a person thinks of me ?" " Will the lotteryticket I have purchased turn up a prize?" " Can you tell me what has become of my husband, whom I have not seen these twenty years ?" and a thousand other like questions. The world thinks that a somnambulist who sees and knows a certain thing can see and know all. The magnetizer himself is no less insatiable. Consider that mistakes must be the consequence of such a mode of operating ; too many are often made even in following a route with great circumspection. What can we expect from such a chaos of questions ? Deception for all, shame and vexation for the magnetizer, and insanity or stupidity for the somnambulist thus tortured ; fortunate for him if physical tortures be not added to moral ones. I am not at all surprised that somnambulism should lose in the public mind its sacred and divine character. You wish to learn so much from it that you know nothing. If, in spiritual researches, we were to proceed in this way, we should obtain but very little. It is necessary, as I have said, to write down beforehand the questions we intend putting — acquaint the clairvoyante with them, that he may prepare for them. These questions should be clear and few in number, touching only on one subject, with no objections, and thus terminating the sitting. The answers obtained will supply new questions for the following sitting. Never make two similar experiments at the same sitting y if you would succeed ; no pride, no interested calculation. Be jDatient, kind. The stone that caused your fall to-day should warn you to pick out a better road. It is for you to guide your clairvoyante in it carefully and firmly.

>52. " When you rise, through ecstasy, toward heaven, the sensation you experience is, I suppose, similar to that experienced by a person dying." " No ; I rise in good health, experience no obstacle, whereas at death, the soul is much more cramped in quitting the body disorganized by illness ; then there is sufFeringr, but I feel none in the state I am." — " WTiat effect is produced in you when you behold beneath you the earth, which must appear very obscure compared to the brilliant light of heaven V " We make no reflections; we neither think of the earth nor of any one ; we rise in a sensation of happiness, of joy impossible to describe, we would wish to remain there." — " May it not be an error of your senses this pretended elevation toward heaven, or rather an interior nervous expansion, illumed by bright electric rays surrounding the soul, which, possibly is, in its corporeal interior, and enjoys the happiness of this sight which it fancies it tastes from without." " How admit such an error, when one feels as I feel, sees what I see ; traverses clouds, space, and arrives in the midst of relations, friends, who all stretch out to you their arms, overwhelm you with caresses, and seek by all possible means to prove to you the pleasure they feel in seeing you, and desire with a common accord that you should soon rejoin them. If we look upon all this as error, I know not then how we are to recognise truth." — '* There are narcotics which produce hallucinations more or less agreeable, and display to us pictures, scenes, somewhat similar to ecstasy, and such, however, are errors." *' There you are again at discussion and doubt. It is a practice with men to treat as erro7's what they do not comprehend ; it is an easy way of settling the matter. Narcotics convey trouble into the nervous system, disturb the soul in its vital fnnctions, throw it into the world of causes, when it makes unheard-of efforts to remain in the world of effects. The soul confounds the domain of the memory ; the pictures of the ineffaceable actions which all men have within them, with the pictures of the world of causes in which it wanders for a moment. It can perceive in this state the most burlesque scenes tacked on to rational ones ; because it knows not how to separate them, knows not where it is, knows not what they are; the reservoir of its imagination overflows, and hurries it into the absurd. But is it the same in ecstasy : is all that I tell you under the empire of folly ? What is predicted to me and which is accomplished, is it of the domain of error ? The views at distances, the descriptions of places : what is done or said there ; are they errors ; All the somnambulists who thus see do they not prove that they are no longer in their body, since they reproduce to you facts, scenes, conversations of which you have never heard speak, and which take place for the first thxie at the very instant they are communicated to you. What can you say to those facts ? Be reasonable, then, and believe that all the savans in the world can not deny what I have just cited, and which is operated every day at each instant; they will be obliged to extend the properties of the body, if they are unwilling to give it a soul, and these properties will be as obscure in their solution as those of the soul, or they will accept the latter j then they will give it the power of travelling out of the body, reading thouo-hts, seeing actions past and future, and when they have acknowledged such a soul, they will not refuse its going in search of repose to a place of recompense for all the sufferings which it has endured in this world of grief." — " I thank you for your inoenious and frank explanation. I have nothing to say against it." 53. " Once more, allow me to make an observation on the last sitting. My reason for doubting that your soul was out of your body, is, that scarcely have I spoken, than you answer me ; and I do not perceive your body making any movement when you say that you are receiving the caresses of your relatives." " It is, however, this want of movement in my body, in my grand ecstatic movements, which ought to prove to you that I am no longer in it ; when my relatives, on the contrary, come on earth to see me, you perceive my spiritual hand pressin<r theirs, my body gesticulating, because they are really there present and I also ; but when I am in heaven, my body can no longer make the same gestures, since there is no longer a soul within it. If I answer you immediately, it is because I still cling to my body by sympathetic threads which you seem to me to hold like cords, forcing me, when you draw them, to descend to the power of your will." — " In views, at distances, although the somnambulists are in other places, their body is not deprived of movement." " The comparison holds not good. They are on earth at slight distances comparatively with those of heaven; they are not in the ecstatic condition necessary to communicate with heaven, and hence the separation of the soul and body is not the same." — I perceive that Adele purposes entering into the ecstatic state j I make up my mind to try a decisive experiment, and leave her to her will ; I forthwith send Bruno to sleep, put him en rapport with her, and beg him to follow her as far as possible, recommending him not to be alarmed, and to warn me only if he should see danger. I wished to be assured by myself of the pretended dangers of ecstasy. Frequently had Adele told me that she had been on the point of not coming back to re-enter her body, and as I thought that she only wanted to alarm me, I wished to know what opinion to come to. At the lapse of a quarter of an hour, Bruno exclaims in great alarm, ** I have lost sighfof her!" I had relied upon him, and paid little attention to Adele, whose body in the meanwhile had grown icy cold ; there was no longer any pulse or respiration ; her face was of a sallow green, her lips blue, her heart gave no sign of life. I placed before her lips a mirror, but it was by no means tarnished by them. I magnetized her powerfully, in order to bring back her soul into her body, but for five minutes my labor was vain. Bruno, alai'med at my want of success, as well as the persons present at this sitting, tended greatly to disturb me. I thought for a moment that the work was consummated, and that I had an indubitable proof that the soul had departed from her body. I was obliged to request the persons present to pass into another room, in order that I might recover by myself a little energy. At the lapse of a few moments, I entertained the hope that I should not have such a misfortune to deplore ; but, physically speaking, I was utterly powerless. Falling on my knees, I asked back of God, in my prayer, the soul that I had in my doubts suffered to depart. I seemed, by an effect of intuition to know that my prayer was heard : after a minute's further anguish, I obtained these words : *' Why have you called me back % it was all over with me ! but God moved at your prayer, sent me back to you. No more shall I be permitted to return to heaven; I am punished." — "Of what punishment do you speak?" "Raphael has forbidden my mother and all my relations, except Alphonse, to come and see me again, until further orders, and it is to you that I am indebted for this privation. I shall no longer be able to ascend to heaven, but had it not been for you I should have been there now and for ever." It may be naturally supposed that I paid bat little attention to her complaints and reproaches.

>65. The abbe said to me, " You will have the goodness to ask, at the next sitting, for M, De Mallet (Christophe Edouard), and send me word whether he appeared, and in what condition." I much doubted this experiment, for which we had. so little information to work upon. I asked for him, however, and, to my great satisfaction he appeared. I ask ihis gentleman if he will be good enough to answer a few questions which the abbe desires to put to him V " Yes," replied he ; I told him that at the first sitting they would discourse together ; meanwhile I beg Adele to give me a description of this gentleman. *' He is a priest, or, at least, he wears the costume of one ; a black robe, without surplice : he is a litrle taller than the abbe, stout in proportion ; he has a noble countenance, a prominent nose, the nostrils somewhat pinched up ; he has a mark on his cheek, under the left eye ; his hair is gray, and he may be sixty." — " Are you quite sure that he has a mark on his left cheek, under the eye ?" — '* Yes, it is evident enough." " What kind of mark, a pockmark ?" — " I can not see because he is a pretty good distance off; but I am certain that he has a mark of some kind." This gentleman retires. Adele is afraid that the abbe should raise any difficulties as to this apparition, and says that she won't ask for any more if she has been deceived.

>73. M. Demarest, Eliza's husband, came the next day, according to appointment. I magnetized Adele. He then said to me, " I lost a sister, whose name I hand you ; be so kind as to request her attendance." " Here she is." — " Give me a description of her ]" said he. (He was not en rapport with Adele.) The latter replied, " She is rather taller than this gentleman, her brother ; her hair is of a dark flaxen color, her face is long, and she has large blue eyes of a very sweet expression." On the observation of M. Demarest, as to whether Adele has a good view of her eyes, the latter draws nearer to her the gentleman's sister, and says that " the right eye seems to her as if somewhat dimmed." " It is a web," said this gentleman, " that grew in her eye, in consequence of an accident." — " Her mouth is small," resumes Adele, " skin very white, complexion pale, but the cheeks are somewhat flushed like those of consumptive persons, and her deportment is melancholy." Adele feels conscious that she must have been dearly loved on earth, and she reckons her about eighteen years of age. There is in her voice something sweet, but drawling. She tells her brother that their father, supposed by those around him to be on his death-bed, sixty leagues from Paris, was out of danger ; that he should be consoled for tlie loss of Eliza ; that she herself appeared to him expressly to convince him of the reality of another existence after death. She was accompanied by a young girl whom her brother could not recognise from the description given of her by Adele, and whom his sister said was one of her old school friends. M. Demarest acknowledged all the details of the description as exact apart the age, which Adele gave her as an approximation to the real one, his sister being twenty-one when she died ; apart, the color of the hair, which, said he, was of a chestnut color; Adele saw it of a dark flaxen; then again the eye, which she had not discovered at once, inasmuch as this person was on one side and at a distance from Adele ; the rest was very exact, even to the revelation of the recovery of their father, which they did not hear of till some days afterward. Would it be believed, these three facts sufficed M. Demarest to doubt the reality of the apparition. A somnambulist who makes a mistake of three years in the appreciation of age, and this gentleman declares that his sister was not that age ; then again, as to a shade more or less dark of the hair, and a slight delay in the discovery of a web in the eye ! this is sufficient for this man to doubt so detailed an apparition ; all the other particularities, even to the tone of her voice, are strictly exact; her father, whom he thought dead, and whose recovery was announced to him, sufficed not this uneasy and suspicious man ; as much less was required to make me believe, and I had been as far off as he from siicb persuasions. I will observe that at the sitting he believed, and was greatly astonished; it was only at a later period that these facts disappeared from his memory to inake way for these three trifling objections * We can not say, after such a sitting, that Adele saw or read his thoughts, had it been so they would have agreed as to the age, the color of the hair ; and, above all, the eye, which was the most distinctive sign of the apparition, would have been cited first. Men of right understanding, who consider well of this apparition, will, I think, come to a different conclusion, particularly if I inform them that I had a little somnambulist, ten years of age (he will be seen hereafter), possessing the speciality of views at distances, who one day, placed en rajjport with this M. Demarest, and visiting his abode, made the remark that he saw on a small table a blue surtout. M. Demarest would not accept this view, because, instead of a surtout it was a paletot. A small sou of ten centimes, no longer circulated but for a Hard, being put in a box, the child says, *' I see a Hard," whereupon this gentleman exclaimed, '* This child is not asleep ; he knows not what he says."

>I repeated to him what I said in my introduction, that " I should deem mj'self the most coDtempiible being on earlh if I specuUited on such falselioods. All that I recounted was the sacred trulh." He then said to me : " Would you be so kind as to give me a sitting?" I eagerly ofFeted fo gratify his wish. Adeie visited (spiritually) his daughter and wife, who could not for a single moment doubt her excellent clairvoyance. Madame Mirande can not make use of the thumb of her rififht hand. Adele asked her if she had not magnetized some one 1 This lady replied that she was acquainted with magnetism only by name; but that from what she had seen Adele do, when showing M. Mirande how he should magnelize his daughter, whose arm is paralyzed, she recollected that a doctor had once taught lier how to perform frictions on the arm of one of her friends who had lost the use of it. She had rendered her this service for nearly a. fortnight; but finding that it fatigued her and gave her pains in the thumb, she left off; and it is only since then that her thumb has been in this state. Adele said to her : *' It was magnetism that you performed then ; the doctor ought to have warned you to shake your finsrers to disensfaoe yourself from the bad fluid you absorbed, and wash your hands in water acidulated with vinegar, as I recommend your husband to do after each magnetization." This lady acknowledged that Adele's was a just observation, since her thumb was not in this state previous to the above time, and that she had received no blow or any injury that could have occasioned what she felt. (A warning to those who do not believe in the transmission of disease.) M. Mirande, from the first sitting of somnambulism he had ever seen, was convinced of the reality of what was said with respect to maladies. But he wished to know what opinion to come to as to the revelations of the " Secrets ;" consequently he begged Adele to ask for the apparition of his brother, whom he believed killed in the Russian campaign. Adele, not seeing him in the spiritual world, said that he was not dead; that she saw him on earth. She gave the following description of him : "I see a tall stout man, with brown hair, fine black lively eyes, and of a tender expression; a mouth neither large nor small, beautiful teeth, nose well made, cheeks colored, air gracious, and very cheerful. He seems to me about thirty years of age, and is rather taller than M. Mirande. He wears the uniform of a sub-officer (I believe), because I see him with only one epaulette, blue coat, pantaloons of the same color, with scarlet edgings, shako with visor ; altogether he is a fine man." — "Ask him in what country he is]" "He does not know, or lie has no viind to tell me. He says that he has undergone much suffering. He was made a prisoner and sent to the very interior of Russia, in countries bordering on China, 1 believe ; he tells me that his brother will see him again." *' AVhy has he not written to him V " He did write, but the letters have either been lost or miscarried." — " Why does he no longer write 1" " He knows not whether his brother is still alive." — " Tell him that he is alive and takes upon himself to find out the place of his retreat." " He answers that he can not say when, but that he is in hopes, one day, of taking his brother by surprise." — " What does he do there ?" *' He is very comfortable, has lands of his own, turns them to account, and employs many persons. Could he have managed to dispose of his property, he would have been before this in France ; but thereabouts purchasers are not to be found as with us; he can't tell when he shall succeed in selling off." — " Let him write to his brother." " He has no opportunity. You think it an easy matter ; he is very far from the sea ; then again he has a wish to take his brother by surprise, when he returns, rich and happy. He is not selfish, he has an excellent heart, but he is not free from ambition ; he always was ambitious. He has dreamed of only one thing in his life, — being rich in his old days, and he is at the height of his wishes." — " Is he married V* ** Yes ; but he has no children. Next time I will beg him to show me the country he lives in, as well as his house and wife." Adele is fatigued, and desires to be roused. M. Miranda asks for further particulars as to the costume of his brother. Adele repeats what she has already said, and adds that " she believes she saw gold lace on his breast, what we call hrandehourgs ; she likewise thinks that he had white facings to his coat." M. MiraTide acknowledcred that all the details as to the personal appearance were exact, as well as those in respect to the character, and so forth, of his brother. The brother of this gentleman had served in the departmental guard, previous to the Russian campaign. M. Mirande believes that such was the costume, only he did not know that he was a sub-officer. He is much surprised that his brother, who must be fifty-six years old, should look no more than thirty. Adele makes the observation to him that she sees him at the moment he left France. "At that time," replies M. Mirande, "he was not above oneand-twenty. He looks to you full thirty ; no doubt the fatigue he underwent made him grow old soon." Adele resumes : " As you knew him only a soldier of one-and-twenty, he appears to me an officer, and older. Several years may have elapsed since that time and the moment I see him. This is very admissible. If I beheld him at the age one-and-twenty, it would be said that I see in the thought. If, on the contrary, I saw him at the age he is now, fifty-six, his brother would not recognise him." M. Mirande can very well understand this. He has not the least doubt but that it was his brother who appeared. Ho can not recover his astonishment. I will add, as a reflection to this apparition: 1. If Adele had seen this man in M. Mirande's thought, she would have seen him as a private soldier, about twenty-one years of age. 2. It would have been sufficient for her to have given this gentleman a few particulars, then to have broken off with the observation that his brother was dead. Such was M. Mirande's opinion. Adele, on the contrary, gives details as to the existence and life of this man; she makes judicious observations. If she saw him at his present age, and in his present dress and occupations, his brother could never have recognised him. The only objection admissible is, that he ought to have given the name of the place he lives in. It remains to know whether he is able or willing to do so. To be able, this place must have a name; and all the countries of the globe are not like France, where each hamlet is dependent on a city, this city on a department, &c. Those uncultivated, remote countries, but little known to geography, possess not names so easy to class as with us. We experienced the same difficulty in our perception of Mexico. Then, again, if this man is unwilling to acquaint us with the place he lives in, for reasons of his own, we can not force him. He evades the question by saying : " I have been a prisoner; I have written ; I have no opportunity; I know not whether my brother is still living," &c. The future will tell us more about it. This apparition proves to us that if men still on earth can appear in the dress, the features, and age, they no longer have, souls disengaged from matter may surely have the same power ; and we acquire the certitude, by this fact, that all that I have said, in this respect, is correct. Each garment, each year, imprints an ineffaceable image on our bodies, which may be found again, at all times, agreeably to the desire of the spirit. I have made this experiment several times ; I have asked for persons living on earth at different periods of their life ; they have appeared at the age demanded, clad in the costume they then wore. I have made inquiries of them, and obtained the assurance that this was correct. I was far from having known these persons when of the age at which I asked for them. In somnambulism, there is a continual source of observation. To succeed we must not argue ; we must study — not believe without pi oofs, and not deny without knowing. I will even go so far as to say that we have no right to deny what we can not comprehend.

>107. Adele is not apprized of E mile's sitting. I have prepared the following questions, which I beg her to submit to M. Swedenborg ; " The two beings created for each other, are they in every respect alike as to physiognomy ?" " No, they are only exactly similar as to affections." — " May one be a white and the other a black ?" " Yes." — " Can a white be united to a negress V " Yes." — " Do negroes preserve their black complexion in heaven ?" " In heaven all men are white ; it is only on earth, from the effect of climate, that they are of different colors." — " When blacks reappear on earth, do they resume their black color ?" " Yes, it must be so, otherwise they would not be recognised." — " Negroes among each other do ihey see themselves black, if such is their affection'?" «' There are no negroes who like their color. When they compare it with that of the whites, they envy the white color. They prefer us in all. Black women seek after white men, and black men after white women. They have no affection for their color, had they any they would be deprived of it in heaven where all men are white." — " Can a black child be united with a white child, each having died in its own color ?" " Yes." — *' Have children, among each other, books to study 1" " Those that desire it have them."—" Is each pair of children under the special care of a superior spirit charged with their instruction V *• The spirit charged with this instruction has not less than a number of children, and that number is twenty." — " What kind of instruction is given them V " That which God deems suitable." — " Are children crowned at a feast which is general with them ]" " There are religious festivals and usages in heaven as on earth ; but all children are generally crowned at the age of seven years." — " There are years, then, in heaven ?" " Time, as I have before said, is not reckoned there as on earth ; it is no longer a necessity, one is not obliged to put off till the morrow the desire which is satisfied as soon as formed ; the calculation of time becomes needless there. It is only for children still subject to the usages necessary to complete their instruction that time is counted." — " Children, from their earliest age, can they be united if they died at about the same time ?" " Yes, but they are not ultimately united before the age of fifteen years ; it is the age of eternal union." — "Can a child be ignorant of its having lived spiritually on another globe before appearing on earth ?" ** No one is ignorant of such existence ; it is for want of thought if some do not speak of it." — " Children perfected, do they caress each other by kisses or other demonstrations ?" " Yes : but their ordinary caress is shaking hands affectionately until they are ultimately united." — " There have appeared to us children who did not seem to have made any progress since their departure from the earth ; do they remain long in such state 1" " A time more or less long." — " Can they, like grown-up persons, remain an unlimited time in innocent pleasures V " Yes." — ■' Do children believe that they speak through speech or thought?" " They believe that they speak through speech." I had put this question to Emile's guide, and he answered me in the same sense. Having exhausted the questions I had prepared for this sitting, I was about to rouse Adele when she made a gesture of surprise, and tendered, with the greatest vivacity, her hand to some one who was near her, and caused her so powerful an emotion that she shed tears in abundance. "What creates in you this surprise 1" said I to her. " It is Alphonse." — " What ! Alphonse, who for so long a period has not paid you a visit 1" (About eighteen months.) " He, himself," replied she. — " Has he anything to tell you '?" " It seems to him, he says, but two days ago." — " He does not grow weary where he is." " I perceive as much." Adele expressed a wish to chat with this cherished brother; T left her a moment, but soon perceived that she was entering the complement of ecstasy. I felt her pulse, to guide myself by its pulsations, when I thought it time to recall her to earth ; 1 did so, and she obeyed me without a murmur, exclaiming : " Yes, our departure from this miserable globe, our descent into the grave, is the first step we take toward pei-fect equality ; fortune, title, grandeur, ugliness, deformity, grief, misery — all this passes under the spiritual level, and emerges from it, equalized for ever ; love, fraternily, replace egotism and ambition. Oh ! my God, wherefore men do they not appreciate thy divine mercy 1 wherefore dost thou send me back among them 1 My time is not ended, let us re-enter this prison and hope !" I had sacrificed this sitting, as I have said, to verify whether all that Emile's guide told me was correct; we have seen that there is accord : 1. As to the color of the hair, which may be different between two beings, as we have the proof direct in Ai's and his companion, hers being flaxen and his black. 2. As to the possible union of a white with a negress. 3. As to the disappearance of the black color in heaven, where all beings are white. 4. On the necessity of appearing on earth in the color we bore there. 5, On the possibility of having books in heaven, if children are fond of them.

>108. When I intrusted to the printer my manuscript of the " Secrets," I had not a duplicate of it, my employment permitting me not to copy such a work : I recommended it, therefore, to M. Mirande, director of the printing-office, harassed as I was by a secret inquietude, still further augmented by the somewhat unfavorable disposition of mind into which my prospectus had thrown certain members of different sects. Several of them having come to me for more ample information as to the religious tendency of this work, I had frankly answered them that my object was to tell all that had been revealed to me, without, in aught, perverting the meaning to the advantage of any particular belief. I agreed not with these gentlemen for two reason : 1. I believe God to be infinitely good — not subject to fits of vengeance and cruelty. 2. I believe that in all religions we might be saved. No more was necessary for these stupid and egotistical men to make them augur ill of the soundness of my work. One day a disciple of Swedenborg quitted me, saying : " Monsieur, with such disposition of mind, you can but have written your work under a very bad influence. It could not have been M. Swedenborg who came to you ; but I predict to you that in a few days he will appear in person to you yourself, to undeceive you and forbid you printing it." I answered this gentleman, that '• the day I should have the honor of such a visit would be one of the happiest of my life." He quitted me in a very bad humor, being unable to contain his displeasure before a lady present, who was a follower of Swedenborg, and worthy of respect fi'om her great age and enlightened understanding, the fruit of long and painful meditations. Matters stood thus. A vexatious idea came into my head, that if it were possible, certain persons inimical to this work might make away with it. One day I received a proof to correct, with a part of the manuscript, of which it was the reproduction. What was my surprise on seeing that twenty-six pages of the manuscript had been so burned that it was very difficult to read their contents : these pages were actually those containing all the revelations of M. Swedenborg. I was confounded. Next day M. Mirande came to my house : I begged him frankly to tell me, since this accident had been attended by no untoward results, whether it had occurred before, during, or after the com230sition. This gentleman replied that it happened before the composition, in the room of the reader. The latter was about looking over the manuscript ; some one came to speak to him ; he laid down this part on the top of his stove, which was very hot at that moment, and perceived his distraction only from a strong smell of burning; he instantly withdrew my manuscript, which, had it remained there a second lonsj'er, would have been annihilated. I knew not what to think of such an accident, when yesterday I asked M. Swedenborg the cause of it. He replied : " This accident was prepared by evil spirits, who wanted to annihilate the truths I have revealed to you." — " Is it to you that I am indebted for its non-execution V *' Let it suffice you to know that good spirits watched over its preservation, as they watch over yours and your claitvoyante's. Had these evil spirits the power, they would lay a spell on you. But fear not ; those who conceived such vengeance will be the first to read you, and will learn to repent of their error. You ought to remember that I came the morning after this accident, to assure you that your work would appear unshackled, for such is the will of God. Be calm : among my disciples, as in all religions, there are false men who pervert to their profit my writings ; but they will not succeed in establishing their doctrines." I did not exactly recollect, not having taken down the dale, whether M. Swedenborg: came to see Adele the morninsf after this accident ; but I still await the fulfilment of the prediction of his disciple, and I think that, after reading this work, he will be enabled to judge whether it has been dictated by the evil one, or l)y a beneficent spirit. I availed myself of the presence of M. Swedenborg to put to him the following question : " At the last sitting you explained to me how years were estimated in heaven ; but I did not perfectly comprehend your explanation : could you furnish me with a little additional information on this point]" "In heaven there are no years as on earth; I have told you that children dying before the age of seven years, were all crowned at that age, and those fifteen years old in like manner. I merely borrowed the word * years' as a figurative expression, to make myself understood by your clairvoyante, for in heaven they are degrees. The age of seven years represents the degree of knowledge ; that of fifteen the degree of love, and so on." Adele said to me : " It is true that M. Swedenborg always spoke to me of degrees; but, not comprehending these degrees, I begged him to explain this to me otherwise, in order that I might the better reproduce to you what he said to me ; for if I do not myself comprehend, how should I make you do so ? Then again, he told me that time was not reckoned in heaven, where all was by degrees of affection. On earth, children seven years of age, are, it is said, at the age of knowledge ; it is this want of knowledge that is crowned in heaven : the child, were it not to enter this degree till after twenty of our years, represents the child of seven years with us. It is the same with respect to the age of fifteen, when we feel on earth the first approaches of love. In heaven it is a degree — an affection similar to that of the child entering the state of knowledge. There is no limited time : when this affection enters the person, we say he is in the degree of love, which corresponds to the age of fifteen on our earth." I am aware that some of M. Swedenhorg's works treat of degrees, but I am not acquainted with them. (I leave the reader to judge of the revelations of this sitting, in respect to the accident that befell my manuscript.)

>Be strengthened more and more. M. B , desirous of concealing his name, out of family considerations, signed the duplicate of this sitting, to guaranty me in future against the reservations that some forgetful and wrangling men might raise as to the reality of what they have heard and acknowledged as true. Henceforth, I shall act in the same way. The morning after this sitting, M. B came to my house to tell us that he had called together his family, to make sure of the precise color of his brother's eyes, and that the generality of reminiscences was in favor of the color described by Adele. This particularity gave me great pleasure, inasmuch as this gentleman having said to Adele, *' You are wrong ; my mother thinks his eyes were blue ; do you persist in seeing them of a hazel color ?" Adele replied, " It would be very easy for me to say as your mother, since she believes them such, and that would add to the truth of all I told you ; but I should be telling a falsehood and not saying what I saw : to me they are as I have described them." It was in consequence of this declaration that the gentleman convoked a family meeting, and thought himself bound to inform me of the result. M. B confided to me that he had often had a visit from his brother in his dreams; that some time ago he dreamed, that after his brother was dead and laid out, he beheld the lid of the coffin raised, his brother rise up on his feet, extend his arms, tearing the shroud, and say to him in a calm, steady voice : " Why do you weep for me ? Don't you see that I am not dead ; on the contrary, I am born to life — this is the entrance to it [pointing to his coffin] — we shall meet again ; be calm and hope."

>Third Sitting. — M. Blouet gave an account of this fresh sitting to his friend, who came himself to the house a few days after, and assured us that, from the information he had obtained as to this woman, Adele had given a correct description of her as well as of the place where she used to go to bed, and the three cellars which still exist. I put this gentleman in correspondence with Adele, who told him the spot where she thought the treasure would be found. The gentleman acknowledged that the particulars relative to the cellars were exact, and as to the treasure researches only could prove how far she was correct.

>Accordingly, I now proceed with the evidence. In 1820, numerous experiments were performed by me in Paris, at the Hotel-Dieu, and many incredulous physicians, attracted by the novelty, witnessed them, and wished to satisfy themselves that there was no deception. To this I assented, and accordingly they proceeded to prove the insensibility of the patients by a variety of tests, many of which were very cruel ; but these experiments were not performed by me ; it was a sort of sacrifice of humanity which incredulity insisted upon, and in the infancy of the science I had no alternative excepting to permit them, or allow truth itself to be compromised by the refusal. Hence the unconscious patients were subjected to the following trials : — their lips and nostrils were tickled with feathers ; their skin was pinched until ecchymoses (bruises) were produced ; smoke was introduced into the nasal passages, and the feet of one female were plunged into a strong infusion of mustard-seed at a high temperature. But not the slightest sign of pain did they evince. The expression of the countenance remained unchanged, nor was the pulse in any degree affected. On being awakened, however, out of the magnetic sleep, they all experienced the pain usually attendant on such applications, and were exceedingly angry at the treatment they had received. Many of the physicians who had witnessed this scene, and who were convinced of the reality of the magnetic influence, applied to me to teach them how to conduct the operation, and several very soon acquired the method, upon which they proceeded to convince themselves, by their own personal experiments, of the absolute extinction of sensibility in such cases. The means they adopted were on many occasions revolting, but the result removed every shade of doubt from their minds. I now, therefore, proceed to adduce their evidence. It is no longer I who attest the facts ; and praise or blame, should either be bestowed, will be alike inapplicable to me. Here, therefore, I subjoin the following proces-verbal by Dr. Kobouam, who was then attached to the Hotel-Dieu. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 6th of January, 1821, M. Recamier, on visiting the hospital, requested me to put into magnetic sleep a man named Starin, whose bed was No. 8 of the ward Sainte-Madelaine. M. Recamier first threatened him with the application of moxa,* if he allowed himself to fall asleep, and I caused the patient, much against his will, to pass into the magnetic sleep, during which M. Recamier applied the moxa on the fore-part of the right thigh, which moxa produced an eschar seventeen lines in length and eleven in breadth ; that Starin did not manifest the least sign of pain, either by crying out, gesture, or variation of the pulse ; that he did not feel the application of the moxa until I had roused him out of the magnetic sleep. Madame SainteMonique, the matron of the ward, MM. Gibert, La Peyre, Bergeret, Carquet, Truche, &c, &c, were present during this seance" Here, also, is another procesverbal by the same physician. " I, the undersigned, certify, that on the 8th of January, 1821, at the request of M. Recamier, I put into magnetic sleep the woman Leroy (Lise), lying in the bed No. 22 in the ward Sainte-Agnes. M. Recamier had previously threatened that he would apply a moxa to her person if she allowed herself to fall asleep. I, Robouam, then, much against her will, caused the patient to fall into magnetic sleep, during which M. Gibert burned agaric under her nostrils, and this nauseous smell produced no perceptible effect ; that afterwards M. Recamier himself applied moxa on the epigastric region (pit of the stomach), which produced an eschar of fifteen lines in length and nine in breadth ; that during the operation, the patient did not shew the least symptoms of suffering, either by cries, gestures, or variation of the pulse ; that she remained in a state of perfect insensibility, and that on awakening from the magnetic sleep, she shewed signs of suffering great pain. MM. Gibert, Crequi, &c, were present at this seance? (Signed,) Robouam, Docteur-Medecin.
## 15: Denis (1838) 267 [2]

>The magnetic influence, when thus communicated, instead of inducing sleep, generally gives rise to spasms, convulsions, and alarming symptoms. On another occasion, I was magnetising a lady who was but little sensible of the magnetic influence^ when a person who stood beside her felt, during the operation, her limbs benumbed, and pricking pains in her eyelids. On the following day the same lady was again magnetised, without the intention of producing an effect on any one else ; but the same attendant again experienced symptoms more decided than on the preceding day, and remained the whole of that day afterwards in a state of excessive lassitude. Again, at the next seance she was affected so much that somnambulism was brought on, and yet I had no intention of producing this result. She soon awoke ; but, yielding to sleep again, she remained in this state for several hours. A similar incident occurred to me while operating at the house of a patient of mine, the wife of a counsellor of state. Her lady's-maid, who attended the sitting to render assistance if necessary, was seized, while I was magnetising her mistress, with severe spasms, which soon became very alarming. I rose to subdue them, but she hurried away, declaring that I gave her pain, and that she would not allow me to come near her. She, however, soon recovered, and I attributed the effects only to an excited imagination. When perfectly recomposed, she sat down again near to her mistress, upon whom I recommenced the magnetic operation as before. But in about five minutes, and without any intention on my part to exert any influence on this attendant, she was again seized with the same description of paroxysm, accompanied with considerable pain and difficulty of breathing, from which she did not recover for several days afterwards.

>There is yet another circumstance that merits further attention. The earliest manifestations in France, as in the United States, were not written or oral, but were transmitted through rapping or knocking that indicated the letters of the alphabet, forming words and sentences. This is how the communicating intelligences declared themselves to be spirits. Although we admit the involvement of the medium’s mind in the production of verbal or written communications, we cannot attribute the same involvement on the part of the medium in producing rapping or knocks. The medium could not have known them beforehand.

>Theo. We do not. But as this question of the duality — the individuality of the Divine Ego, and the personality of the human animal — involves that of the possibility of the real immortal Ego appearing in Seance rooms as a "materialised spirit," which we deny as already explained, our opponents have started the nonsensical charge.
## 18: Blavatsky (1889) 391 [1]

>Enq. You seem very bitter against Spirits. As you have given me your views and your reasons for disbelieving in the materialization of, and direct communication in seances, with the disembodied spirits — or the "spirits of the dead" — would you mind enlightening me as to one more fact? Why are some Theosophists never tired of saying how dangerous is intercourse with spirits, and mediumship? Have they any particular reason for this?
## 19: Blavatsky (1889) 394 [1]

>Theo. It is because I believe in them with too good reason, and (save some cases of deliberate fraud) know them to be as true as that you and I live, that all my being revolts against them. Once more I speak only of physical, not mental or even psychic phenomena. Like attracts like. There are several high-minded, pure, good men and women, known to me personally, who have passed years of their lives under the direct guidance and even protection of high "Spirits," whether disembodied or planetary. But these Intelligences are not of the type of the John Kings and the Ernests who figure in seance rooms. These Intelligences guide and control mortals only in rare and exceptional cases to which they are attracted and magnetically drawn by the Karmic past of the individual. It is not enough to sit "for development" in order to attract them. That only opens the door to a swarm of "spooks," good, bad and indifferent, to which the medium becomes a slave for life. It is against such promiscuous mediumship and intercourse with goblins that I raise my voice, not against spiritual mysticism. The latter is ennobling and holy; the former is of just the same nature as the phenomena of two centuries ago, for which so many witches and wizards have been made to suffer. Read Glanvil and other authors on the subject of witchcraft, and you will find recorded there the parallels of most, if not all, of the physical phenomena of nineteenth century "Spiritualism."

>1st Sitting. — Binet (Bruno), my first ecstatic, was a young man, twenty-seven years of age, of mild disposition, and very limited intelligence in point of spiritualism, having read and heard but little of magnetism. He submitted to my action with confidence, and presented me with somewhat rare phenomena ; he was not isolated, recollected all he said in his crises, was sent to sleep by a single look from me, underwent the laws of magnetic attraction with a great sensibility, was completely dependent on my influence, and recovered his independence instantaneously ; he beheld perfectly the interior of bodies, and gave salutary counsels, possessed a retrospective view of events and actions dating from a few years to half a century, and described them remarkably well ; he beheld not objects near him, but distinguished them perfectly well at a distance, and gave me great proofs of singular lucidity. I kept a journal devoted to his material views, from which I have extracted whatsoever related to metaphysics and the spiritual world. It was about a week ago that I was magnetizing him, when I beheld him thrown off his seat as if by a thunderbolt, his countenance inflamed, and himself under the influence of a fear, which he sought to disguise from me under the sem.blance of a cou7-age he no longer possessed. *' What is the matter with you?" said I to him. " I have just heard a voice on my right, that told me your complaint was incurable, and that I am no longer to trouble myself about it ; I thought no one was near me, and then I was struck with a commotion that I can not account for." — " Ask who it was spoke to you ?" " It was my guide," is the reply. — "What is the guide's name V " Gabriel." — Bruno answered me in a low voice as the voice spoke to him. He was at least a week in habituating himself to this voice, which was hereafter to be the oracle to answer the questions I put to him with respect to the spiritual world.

>III. The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over‐Soul, the latter being itself an aspect of the Unknown Root; and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul—a spark of the former—through the Cycle of Incarnation, or Necessity, in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic Law, during the whole term. In other words, no purely spiritual Buddhi (Divine Soul) can have an independent conscious existence before the spark which issued from the pure Essence of the Universal Sixth Principle—or the OVER-SOUL—has (a) passed through every elemental form of the phenomenal world of that Manvantara, and (b) acquired individuality, first by natural impulse, and then by self‐induced and self‐devised efforts, checked by its Karma, thus ascending through all the degrees of intelligence, from the lowest to the highest Manas, from mineral and plant, up to the holiest Archangel (Dhyâni‐Buddha). The pivotal doctrine of the Esoteric Philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts in man, save those won by his own Ego through personal effort and merit throughout a long series of metempsychoses and reïncarnations. This is why the Hindûs say that the Universe is Brahman and Brahmâ, for Brahman is in every atom of the universe, the six Principles in Nature being all the outcome—the variously differentiated aspects—of the Seventh and One, the only Reality in the Universe whether cosmic or micro‐cosmic; and also why the permutations, psychic, spiritual and physical, on the plane of manifestation and form, of the Sixth (Brahmâ the vehicle of Brahman) are viewed by metaphysical antiphrasis as illusive and mâyâvic. For although the root of every atom individually and of every form collectively, is that Seventh Principle or the One Reality, still, in its manifested phenomenal and temporary appearance, it is no better than an evanescent illusion of our senses.
## 2: Blavatsky (1888) 678 [1]

>Man is not, nor could he ever be, the complete product of the “Lord God”; but he is the child of the Elohim, so arbitrarily changed into the singular number and masculine gender. The first Dhyânis, commissioned to “create” man in their image, could only throw off their Shadows, as a delicate model for the Nature Spirits of matter to work upon. Man is, beyond any doubt, formed physically out of the dust of the Earth, but his creators and fashioners were many. Nor can it be said that the “Lord God breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life,” unless that God is identified with the “One Life,” omnipresent though invisible, and unless the same operation is attributed to “God” on behalf of every “Living Soul,” which is the Vital Soul (Nephesh), and not the Divine Spirit (Ruach) which ensures to man alone a divine degree of immortality, that no animal, as such, could ever attain in this cycle of incarnation. It is owing to the inadequate distinctions made by the Jews, and now by our Western metaphysicians, who are unable to understand, and hence to accept, more than a triune man—Spirit, Soul, Body—that the “Breath of Life” has been confused with the immortal “Spirit.” This applies also directly to the Protestant theologians, who in translating a certain verse in the Fourth Gospel have entirely perverted its meaning. This mistranslation runs, “the wind bloweth where it listeth,” instead of “the spirit goeth where it willeth,” as in the original, and also in the translation of the Greek Eastern Church.
## 3: Blavatsky (1888) 1967 [1]

>As our Planet revolves once every year around the Sun, and at the same time turns once in every twenty‐four hours upon its own axis, thus traversing minor circles within a larger one, so is the work of the smaller cyclic periods accomplished and recommenced within the Great Saros. The revolution of the physical world, according to the ancient doctrine, is attended by a like revolution in the world of intellect—the spiritual evolution of the world proceeding in cycles, like the physical one. Thus we see in history a regular alternation of ebb and flow in the tide of human progress. The great kingdoms and empires of the world, after reaching the culmination of their greatness, descend again, in accordance with the same law by which they ascended; till, having reached the lowest point, humanity reässerts itself and mounts up once more, the height of its attainment being, by this law of ascending progression by cycles, somewhat higher than the point from which it had before descended.
## 4: Blavatsky (1888) 2106 [1]

>51 “Pilgrim” is the appellation given to our Monad (the Two in one) during its cycle of incarnations. It is the only immortal and eternal Principle in us, being an indivisible part of the integral whole—the Universal Spirit, from which it emanates, and into which it is absorbed at the end of the cycle. When it is said to emanate from the One Spirit, an awkward and incorrect expression has to be used for lack of appropriate words in English. The Vedântins call it Sûtrâtmâ (Thread‐Soul), but their explanation differs somewhat from that of the Occultists; to explain which difference, however, is left to the Vedântins themselves.
## 5: Blavatsky (1889) 61 [1]

>Theo. Before I can answer you, we must argue upon what you mean by "I" or "Ego." We distinguish between the simple fact of self-consciousness, the simple feeling that "I am I," and the complex thought that "I am Mr. Smith" or "Mrs. Brown." Believing as we do in a series of births for the same Ego, or re-incarnation, this distinction is the fundamental pivot of the whole idea. You see "Mr. Smith" really means a long series of daily experiences strung together by the thread of memory, and forming what Mr. Smith calls "himself." But none of these "experiences" are really the "I" or the Ego, nor do they give "Mr. Smith" the feeling that he is himself, for he forgets the greater part of his daily experiences, and they produce the feeling of Egoity in him only while they last. We Theosophists, therefore, distinguish between this bundle of "experiences," which we call the false (because so finite and evanescent) personality, and that element in man to which the feeling of "I am I" is due. It is this "I am I" which we call the true individuality; and we say that this "Ego" or individuality plays, like an actor, many parts on the stage of life. (Vide infra, "On Individuality and Personality.") Let us call every new life on earth of the same Ego a night on the stage of a theatre. One night the actor, or "Ego," appears as "Macbeth," the next as "Shylock," the third as "Romeo," the fourth as "Hamlet" or "King Lear," and so on, until he has run through the whole cycle of incarnations. The Ego begins his life-pilgrimage as a sprite, an "Ariel," or a "Puck"; he plays the part of a super, is a soldier, a servant, one of the chorus; rises then to "speaking parts," plays leading roles, interspersed with insignificant parts, till he finally retires from the stage as "Prospero," the magician.
## 6: Blavatsky (1889) 320 [1]

>Theo. You cannot, because you will mix up an abstract representation of the whole with its casual changes of form. Remember that if it can be said of Buddhi-Manas that it is unconditionally immortal, the same cannot be said of the lower Manas, still less of Taijasi, which is merely an attribute. Neither of these, neither Manas nor Taijasi, can exist apart from Buddhi, the divine soul, because the first (Manas) is, in its lower aspect, a qualificative attribute of the terrestrial personality, and the second (Taijasi) is identical with the first, because it is the same Manas only with the light of Buddhi reflected on it. In its turn, Buddhi would remain only an impersonal spirit without this element which it borrows from the human soul, which conditions and makes of it, in this illusive Universe, as it were something separate from the universal soul for the whole period of the cycle of incarnation. Say rather that Buddhi-Manas can neither die nor lose its compound self-consciousness in Eternity, nor the recollection of its previous incarnations in which the two — i.e., the spiritual and the human soul — had been closely linked together. But it is not so in the case of a materialist, whose human soul not only receives nothing from the divine soul, but even refuses to recognise its existence. You can hardly apply this axiom to the attributes and qualifications of the human soul, for it would be like saying that because your divine soul is immortal, therefore the bloom on your cheek must also be immortal; whereas this bloom, like Taijasi, is simply a transitory phenomenon.
## 7: Blavatsky (1889) 375 [1]

>Theo. It is this nature, mysterious, Protean, beyond any grasp, and almost shadowy in its correlations with the other principles, that is most difficult to realise, and still more so to explain. Manas is a "principle," and yet it is an "Entity" and individuality or Ego. He is a "God," and yet he is doomed to an endless cycle of incarnations, for each of which he is made responsible, and for each of which he has to suffer. All this seems as contradictory as it is puzzling; nevertheless, there are hundreds of people, even in Europe, who realise all this perfectly, for they comprehend the Ego not only in its integrity but in its many aspects. Finally, if I would make myself comprehensible, I must begin by the beginning and give you the genealogy of this Ego in a few lines.
## 8: Blavatsky (1889) 409 [1]

>Theo. No, they cannot be so strictly defined in their effects as to show that each individual environment, and the particular conditions of life in which each person finds himself, are nothing more than the retributive Karma which the individual generated in a previous life. We must not lose sight of the fact that every atom is subject to the general law governing the whole body to which it belongs, and here we come upon the wider track of the Karmic law. Do you not perceive that the aggregate of individual Karma becomes that of the nation to which those individuals belong, and further, that the sum total of National Karma is that of the World? The evils that you speak of are not peculiar to the individual or even to the Nation, they are more or less universal; and it is upon this broad line of Human interdependence that the law of Karma finds its legitimate and equable issue.
## 9: Blavatsky (1889) 411 [1]

>Enq. And are there no means by which the distributive or national Karma might be concentred or collected, so to speak, and brought to its natural and legitimate fulfilment without all this protracted suffering?
## 10: Blavatsky (1889) 412 [1]

>Theo. As a general rule, and within certain limits which define the age to which we belong, the law of Karma cannot be hastened or retarded in its fulfilment. But of this I am certain, the point of possibility in either of these directions has never yet been touched. Listen to the following recital of one phase of national suffering, and then ask yourself whether, admitting the working power of individual, relative, and distributive Karma, these evils are not capable of extensive modification and general relief. What I am about to read to you is from the pen of a National Saviour, one who, having overcome Self, and being free to choose, has elected to serve Humanity, in bearing at least as much as a woman's shoulders can possibly bear of National Karma. This is what she says: —
## 11: Blavatsky (1889) 415 [1]

>Theo. What right have we to think so while one-half of humanity is in a position to effect an immediate relief of the privations which are suffered by their fellows? When every individual has contributed to the general good what he can of money, of labour, and of ennobling thought, then, and only then, will the balance of National Karma be struck, and until then we have no right nor any reasons for saying that there is more life on the earth than Nature can support. It is reserved for the heroic souls, the Saviours of our Race and Nation, to find out the cause of this unequal pressure of retributive Karma, and by a supreme effort to re-adjust the balance of power, and save the people from a moral ingulfment a thousand times more disastrous and more permanently evil than the like physical catastrophe, in which you seem to see the only possible outlet for this accumulated misery.
## 12: Blavatsky (1889) 503 [1]

>Theo. The Theosophical ideas of charity mean personal exertion for others; personal mercy and kindness; personal interest in the welfare of those who suffer; personal sympathy, forethought and assistance in their troubles or needs. We Theosophists do not believe in giving money (N. B., if we had it) through other people's hands or organizations. We believe in giving to the money a thousandfold greater power and effectiveness by our personal contact and sympathy with those who need it. We believe in relieving the starvation of the soul, as much if not more than the emptiness of the stomach; for gratitude does more good to the man who feels it, than to him for whom it is felt. Where's the gratitude which your "millions of pounds" should have called forth, or the good feelings provoked by them? Is it shown in the hatred of the East-End poor for the rich? in the growth of the party of anarchy and disorder? or by those thousands of unfortunate working girls, victims to the "sweating" system, driven daily to eke out a living by going on the streets? Do your helpless old men and women thank you for the workhouses; or your poor for the poisonously unhealthy dwellings in which they are allowed to breed new generations of diseased, scrofulous and rickety children, only to put money into the pockets of the insatiable Shylocks who own houses? Therefore it is that every sovereign of all those "millions," contributed by good and would-be charitable people, falls like a burning curse instead of a blessing on the poor whom it should relieve. We call this generating national Karma, and terrible will be its results on the day of reckoning.

>Theo. They are worse for his moral and spiritual growth than meat, for alcohol in all its forms has a direct, marked, and very deleterious influence on man's psychic condition. Wine and spirit drinking is only less destructive to the development of the inner powers, than the habitual use of hashish, opium, and similar drugs.
## 14: Blavatsky (1889) 652 [1]

>Theo. Scarcely. But I must tell you that during the last quarter of every hundred years an attempt is made by those "Masters," of whom I have spoken, to help on the spiritual progress of Humanity in a marked and definite way. Towards the close of each century you will invariably find that an outpouring or upheaval of spirituality — or call it mysticism if you prefer — has taken place. Some one or more persons have appeared in the world as their agents, and a greater or less amount of occult knowledge and teaching has been given out. If you care to do so, you can trace these movements back, century by century, as far as our detailed historical records extend.

>Note. — The buttons that Adele was unable to define were in metal, of a dirty-white ground, and surrounded by a blue circle. In this apparition is a phenomenon extraordinary enough : that is to say, Adele experienced the same kind of illness as this man. I was obliged to disengage her by passes ; she suffered horribly. What answer can we make to such facts ? unless it be that the past, present, and future, are only conditions of being with matter — only a succession of different states, which in a particular state are ever represented in the present — and this would confirm (for this state only) the belief in a creation without beginning or end ; that is to say, an actual, momentaneous one. Stay not to observe what precedes and what follows creation ; the state which it represents to you is for you whatsoever is. I shall be asked whether this man himself suffered at this moment as Adele appeared to suffer. I will answer, no. He is in the world of causes, wherein hnrmony reigns. Had Adele been totally disencraged from her material body, the latter would not have suffered ; it is only the sight of the state of the material body of this man at the time he suffered, that awakens in Adele sympathetic effects in the material molecules, and produces this suffering, the impression of which remained on the spiritual body of this man. We have already said that it was possible for a clairvoyante to perceive a deceased being at any age of his life, as well as in any dress he may have worn at different periods of his life. It must be the same with all external wounds and internal diseases : nothing is effaced; they are so many impressions left, to recall, no doubt, to the individual possessing them, what he has suffered or done at such an age, and to facilitate in him the comparison of his actual state with his prior one, and this must ever be to him a source of happiness; his present position is ever preferable, and that to which he aspires, as an eternal progression, must surpass all the rest. Thus, how many pevS(<ns on earth are there who feel sick at the sight of a sore or the letting of blood ; how many sympathetic eff*ects are there that are communicated in all nervous effects, such as gaping, laughter, crying, epilepsy, convulsions ; how many persons that are unable to follow the respiration or diction of another person without stifling, &;c., &c. I once noticed in Adele a fact of this nature, which I find it impossible to account for. She was consulted by an asthmatical person ; she was seized with sympathetic fits of asthma, and in a few seconds expectorated great quantities of thick mucus of a yellowish-green, with the same effort and as often as the patient. Her pocket-handkerchief was full of these thick humors in a few minutes ! Adele never spits ; and, habitually, she perceives rather than feels the ailments of sick persons, although she has the two properties at once. I leave medicine to explain this phenomenon, as I shall leave many others to psychology and physics.

>It is proper, therefore, to deeply and seriously investigate the original structure and motive power of man, together with the man), complicated parts which are uniformly made evident external: and by understanding the forms and forces, and the consequent perfection which is manifested in the human organism, you will perceive a correspondence to all else, whether superior or subordinate, existing in universal Nature and her laws. Know one and you consequently know the other; and by investigating and exploring all below the power of mind, constituting your own nature, you arrive analogically at the relative powers of the original laws of motion, which have governed from the beginning, and do still manifest an undeviating tendency to universal and eternal progression.
## 17: Davis (1847) 216 [1]

>δ 26. Therefore the Whole is composed of parts, and the parts compose the Whole; and all these combinations in Nature are producing designedly that principle which is so vague and indefinite to the mind —　which is the subject of much contemplation, but not a substance which can be proved to exist by external investigation; though it is known to exist as an eternal ultimate, of which proof —　mathematical demonstration — exists in Nature. And it is only necessary to comprehend general and universal laws, as these point to that spiritual and intellectual principle, which cannot be known to exist by any other process of investigation, external or internal. But it is demonstrated by these known laws, which are constantly producing and developing corresponding principles, ascending in their degrees of perfection. For these laws exhibit an infinite chain of progression: and as the whole forms one great circle, it comprehends and combines all other circles or corresponding motions and developments that exist in subordinate spheres. And so the original Cause uses Nature as an instrument —a means —a vessel fitted in all its various parts and complications, to produce its ultimate, which is Spirit.
## 18: Davis (1847) 258 [1]

>The principles of Nature (as now manifest), and the laws and forces of mechanics, are a progression of the inherent properties and essences primitively contained in all things. The true mechanic looks through Nature, and obtains a conviction of its primitive and original condition: and also from Nature forward and upward, through the Spheres of future and eternal progression, and spiritual development. If he has not a comprehension, he has still an irresistible conviction, of these things. He observes cause, effect, and end, in all things. He can contemplate the state which the natural progress of all things tends to develop. Original design is not manifested, without means to produce an end. He arrives at the conclusion that there cannot be too much activity nor too much rest; that there cannot be illegitimate or catastrophic productions, as arising from the general law and motions of Nature.** He will not take the details and minutia for general and universal truths.

>The conclusion drawn from this reasoning must be irresistible, since Nature presents indications which constantly carry the mind through its connected chains of progression to a true conception of a First Existence, and of that which is to be produced. There must be a Beginning, and also an Ultimate: and of this all things afford demonstration to the mind.

>δ 40. And while admiring the wisdom as seen and felt in all things around and above, the mind is impressed still more deeply, and with a clearer perception, with an attribute still more perfect, viz., that of GOODNESS! The incalculable number of worlds which the mind has previously contemplated, with their power of action and wise adjustment of motion, display goodness and design in all their various spheres and states of activity. Goodness is manifested in the fact that each law of a positive nature produces effects of a negative nature; and the equilibrium existing between all motions and forces, causes the principle of goodness to be displayed from the very centre to the circumference of their united actions. And also all the palaetiological sciences, when traced to the present time, or retraced to causes anterior, show the constant adaptation and succession of parts serving as agents and instruments to produce future effects, and which produce others still, until the whole, up to the formation of Man. presents a united chain of progression, —a system of concentric circles of development, —　and the Whole displays beauty, purpose, and design. Each successive circle evinces an infinite amount of power, wisdom, and goodness, until all combined produce Man as an Ultimate —　and that these all were essential principles and operations carried through Nature, for the very purpose of producing this sublime Result!
